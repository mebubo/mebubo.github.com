title: Bluetooth mouse in linux using blues-tools
---

<p>
Configuring a bluetooth mouse is easy with the excellent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bluez-tools/">bluez-tools</a>
package.
</p>
<p>
First we need to discover the MAC address of the mouse. To do this,
press the button on the mouse labeled "connect" or something similar,
then issue the following command:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-adapter -d
</pre>


<p>
You should see the output similar to the following:
</p>



<pre class="example">Searching...

[00:01:02:03:04:05]
  Name: Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse
  Alias: mouse
  Address: 00:01:02:03:04:05
...
</pre>


<p>
Next we'll connect to the mouse (replace <code>00:01:02:03:04:05</code> with the
MAC adress you saw in the output of the previous command):
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-device -c 00:01:02:03:04:05
Connecting to: 00:01:02:03:04:05
Agent registered
Device: Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse (00:01:02:03:04:05)
Enter PIN code: 0000
Agent released
Done
</pre>


<p>
You'll be asked to enter the PIN code; "0000" worked in my case.
</p>
<p>
Now we can see our mouse in the list of known devices:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-device -l
Added devices:
Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse (00:01:02:03:04:05)
</pre>


<p>
Let's give it a shorter alias:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-device --set 00:01:02:03:04:05 Alias mouse
Alias: Bluetooth Laser Travel Mouse -&gt; mouse
</pre>


<p>
From now on, we can use the alias instead of the MAC address in the
command line.
</p>
<p>
In my experience, setting the <code>Trusted</code> property is necessary for
mouse to be able to reconnect automatically:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-device --set mouse Trusted true
Trusted: 0 -&gt; 1
</pre>



<p>
The only thing that remains is to connect the input service. The
<code>bt-input</code> command does just that:
</p>



<pre class="example">$ bt-input -c mouse
Input service is connected
</pre>


<p>
That's it! After this, the mouse works all the time, including after
reboot or sleep. All you need to do is move your mouse, and it
reconnects within a second.
