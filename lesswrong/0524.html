All aspiring rationalists welcome. The reservation is currently for 21 but can be changed if needed.  Please RSVP if you haven't already.</p><a id="more"></a><p>They have a wide variety including the requested vegetarian options &amp; pizza from an oak wood burning oven, mostly good reviews, casual dress code, the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence 2007, and are just down the road from Montgomery Theater. </p> <p>7.30 should give people time to finish chatting at the theater or freshen up at their hotels, but if you want to come a bit earlier they say they'll probably be able to seat you. If lots of people think 7.30 is too late I could change the time or suggest a cafe for early birds to grab a coffee in before dinner. </p> <p>Please RSVP whether or not you'll be coming, either in a comment or email me at cursor_loop 4t yahoo p0int com. That way if new people want to come as they can take unclaimed places, and I can let the restaurant know if the number changes. If you think you'll be late, please let me know that too so we can ask the restaurant to keep your seat. </p> <p>Also, as my cellphone won't work San Jose, please could someone volunteer their number for unexpectedly late or lost people to ring? </p> <p>Please see <a href="0504.html">here</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/um/bay_area_meetup_for_singularity_summit/] for further info. Hope to see you all on Saturday!</p><blockquote><p>-- Posted on behalf of Michael Howard</p></blockquote></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/v6/san_jose_meetup_sat_1025_730pm/">San Jose Meetup, Sat 10/25 @ 7:30pm</a></p></body></html>
