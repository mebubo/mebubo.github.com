I need someone who can turn out versions of the illustrations that are technically accurate enough to try on beta readers, fast enough and reliably enough that I can ask for revised versions of the illustrations a day later if the beta reader says they didn't understand it.  There is a Google Doc in progress which you would be given permission to edit, containing some hand-drawn attempts on my part to indicate what the illustrations should look like, and a number of finished illustrations from an illustrator who unfortunately cannot put in any further work on this job.</p> <p>For this job, technical accuracy (i.e., if a ratio is 3:4, it should not look like 1:9), understandability, and speed is much more important than beauty - the idea is to get as quickly as possible to a working version with understandable illustrations that has been verified by the beta readers.</p> <p>If interested, email me at yudkowsky@gmail.com.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/6q4/illustrator_needed_intuitive_bayes_20/">Illustrator needed: Intuitive Bayes 2.0</a></p></body></html>
