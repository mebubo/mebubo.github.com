<html><head><title>Explain/Worship/Ignore?</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>Explain/Worship/Ignore?</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 02 September 2007 08:01PM</i></p><div><p><strong>Followup to</strong>: <a href="0079.html">Semantic Stopsigns</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/], <a href="0080.html">Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/]</p> <p>As our tribe wanders through the grasslands, searching for fruit trees and prey, it happens every now and then that water pours down from the sky.</p> <p>"Why does water sometimes fall from the sky?" I ask the bearded wise man of our tribe.</p> <p>He thinks for a moment, this question having never occurred to him before, and then says, "From time to time, the sky spirits battle, and when they do, their blood drips from the sky."</p> <p>"Where do the sky spirits come from?" I ask.</p> <p>His voice drops to a whisper.  "From the before time.  From the long long ago."</p> <p>When it rains, and you don't know why, you have several options.  First, you could simply not ask why&#8212;not follow up on the question, or never think of the question in the first place.  This is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>gnore command, which the bearded wise man originally selected.  Second, you could try to devise some sort of explanation, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain command, as the bearded man did in response to your first question.  Third, you could enjoy the sensation of mysteriousness&#8212;the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">W</span>orship command.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>Now, as you are bound to notice from this story, each time you select <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain, the best-case scenario is that you get an explanation, such as "sky spirits".  But then this explanation itself is subject to the same dilemma&#8212;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">W</span>orship, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>gnore?  Each time you hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain, science grinds for a while, returns an explanation, and then another dialog box pops up.  As good rationalists, we feel duty-bound to keep hitting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain, but it seems like a road that has no end.</p> <p>You hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for life, and get chemistry; you hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for chemistry, and get atoms; you hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for atoms, and get electrons and nuclei; you hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for nuclei, and get quantum chromodynamics and quarks; you hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for how the quarks got there, and get back the Big Bang...</p> <p>We can hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain for the Big Bang, and wait while science grinds through its process, and maybe someday it will return a perfectly good explanation.  But then that will just bring up another dialog box.  So, if we continue long enough, we must come to a <em>special</em> dialog box, a <em>new</em> option, an Explanation That Needs No Explanation, a place where the chain ends&#8212;and this, maybe, is the only explanation worth knowing.</p> <p>There&#8212;I just hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">W</span>orship.</p> <p>Never forget that there are many more ways to worship something than lighting candles around an altar.</p> <p>If I'd said, "Huh, that does seem paradoxical.  I wonder how the apparent paradox is resolved?" then I would have hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">E</span>xplain, which does sometimes take a while to produce an answer.</p> <p>And if the whole issue seems to you unimportant, or irrelevant, or if you'd rather put off thinking about it until tomorrow, than you have hit <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>gnore.</p> <p>Select your option wisely.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions"><em>Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0089.html">'Science' as Curiosity-Stopper</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j0/making_history_available/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq02.html">Sequence 02: Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0089.html">"Science" as Curiosity-Stopper</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a> &#8226; <a href="0089.html">"Science" as Curiosity-Stopper</a> &#8226; <a href="0124.html">A Priori</a> &#8226; <a href="0141.html">No One Knows What Science Doesn't Know</a> &#8226; <a href="0293.html">Joy in the Merely Real</a> &#8226; <a href="0343.html">Quantum Non-Realism</a> &#8226; <a href="0366.html">Einstein's Superpowers</a> &#8226; <a href="0410.html">Where Recursive Justification Hits Bottom</a> &#8226; <a href="0432.html">The Meaning of Right</a> &#8226; <a href="0509.html">Crisis of Faith</a> &#8226; <a href="0708.html">That Crisis thing seems pretty useful</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/j2/explainworshipignore/">Explain/Worship/Ignore?</a></p></body></html>
