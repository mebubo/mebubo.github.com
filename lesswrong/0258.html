Let's say that there's some object with properties A, B, C, D, and E, or at least it looks E-ish.</p> <blockquote> <p>Fred:  "You mean that thing over there is blue, round, fuzzy, and&#8212;"<br>Me: "In Aristotelian logic, it's not supposed to make a difference what the properties are, or what I call them.  That's why I'm just using the letters."</p> </blockquote> <p>Next, I invent the Aristotelian category "zawa", which describes those objects, all those objects, and only those objects, which have properties A, C, and D.</p> <blockquote> <p>Me:  "Object 1 is zawa, B, and E."<br>Fred:  "And it's blue&#8212;I mean, A&#8212;too, right?"<br>Me:  "That's implied when I say it's zawa."<br>Fred:  "Still, I'd like you to say it explicitly."<br>Me:  "Okay.  Object 1 is A, B, zawa, and E."</p> </blockquote> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>Then I add another word, "yokie", which describes all and only objects that are B and E; and the word "xippo", which describes all and only objects which are E but not D.</p> <blockquote> <p>Me:  "Object 1 is zawa and yokie, but not xippo."<br>Fred:  "Wait, is it luminescent?  I mean, is it E?"<br>Me:  "Yes.  That is the only possibility on the information given."<br>Fred:  "I'd rather you spelled it out."<br>Me:  "Fine:  Object 1 is A, zawa, B, yokie, C, D, E, and not xippo."<br>Fred:  "Amazing!  You can tell all that just by looking?"</p> </blockquote> <p>Impressive, isn't it?  Let's invent even more new words:  "Bolo" is A, C, and yokie; "mun" is A, C, and xippo; and "merlacdonian" is bolo and mun.</p> <p>Pointlessly confusing?  I think so too.  Let's replace the labels with the definitions:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Zawa, B, and E" becomes [A, C, D], B, E<br>"Bolo and A" becomes [A, C, [B, E]], A<br>"Merlacdonian" becomes [A, C, [B, E]], [A, C, [E, ~D]]</p> </blockquote> <p>And the thing to remember about the Aristotelian idea of categories is that [A, C, D] is the <em>entire</em> information of "zawa".  It's not just that I can vary the label, but that I can get along just fine without any label at all&#8212;the rules for Aristotelian classes work purely on structures like [A, C, D].  To call one of these structures "zawa", or attach any other label to it, is a human convenience (or inconvenience) which makes not the slightest difference to the Aristotelian rules.</p> <p>Let's say that "human" is to be defined as a mortal featherless biped.  Then the <a href="0245.html">classic syllogism</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/] would have the form:</p> <blockquote> <p>All [mortal, ~feathers, bipedal] are mortal.<br>Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, bipedal].<br>Therefore, Socrates is mortal.</p> </blockquote> <p>The feat of reasoning looks a lot less impressive now, doesn't it?</p> <p>Here the <em>illusion of inference</em> comes from the labels, which conceal the premises, and pretend to novelty in the conclusion.  Replacing labels with definitions reveals the illusion, making visible the tautology's <a href="0245.html">empirical unhelpfulness</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nf/the_parable_of_hemlock/].  You can never say that Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, biped] until you have observed him to be mortal.</p> <p>There's an idea, which you may have noticed I hate, that "you can define a word any way you like".  This idea came from the Aristotelian notion of categories; since, if you follow the Aristotelian rules <em>exactly</em> and <em>without flaw</em>&#8212;<a href="0246.html">which humans never do</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ng/words_as_hidden_inferences/]; Aristotle knew perfectly well that Socrates was human, even though that wasn't justified under his rules&#8212;but, <em>if</em> some imaginary nonhuman entity were to follow the rules exactly, they would never arrive at a contradiction.  They wouldn't arrive at much of anything: they couldn't say that Socrates is a [mortal, ~feathers, biped] until they observed him to be mortal.</p> <p>But it's not so much that labels are <em>arbitrary</em> in the Aristotelian system, as that the Aristotelian system works fine without <em>any labels at all</em>&#8212;it cranks out exactly the same stream of tautologies, they just look a lot less impressive.  The labels are only there to create the <em>illusion</em> of inference.</p> <p>So if you're going to have an Aristotelian proverb at all, the proverb should be, not "I can define a word any way I like," nor even, "Defining a word never has any consequences," but rather, "Definitions don't need words."</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human%27s_Guide_to_Words"><em>A Human's Guide to Words</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/A_Human%27s_Guide_to_Words]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0260.html">Taboo Your Words</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nu/taboo_your_words]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0257.html">The Argument from Common Usage</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nr/the_argument_from_common_usage/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq11.html">Sequence 11: A Human's Guide to Words</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0257.html">The Argument from Common Usage</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0260.html">Taboo Your Words</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0257.html">The Argument from Common Usage</a> &#8226; <a href="0260.html">Taboo Your Words</a> &#8226; <a href="0268.html">Mutual Information, and Density in Thingspace</a> &#8226; <a href="0279.html">37 Ways That Words Can Be Wrong</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ns/empty_labels/">Empty Labels</a></p></body></html>
