Our family is surrounded by genuinely wonderful people who have poured their talents into us since we were teenagers, and our social structure and business rests on the tenets of what we believe. I've been trying to work out how I can 'clear the decks' and then rebuild with whatever is worth keeping, yet it's so foundational that it will affect my marriage (to a pretty special man) and my daughters who, of course, have also been raised to walk the Christian path.</p> <p>Is there anyone who's been in this position - really, really invested in a faith and then walked away?"</p></div></blockquote><div id="comment-138094586-content"><span id="comment-138094586-content">Handling this kind of situation has to count as part of the art.  But I haven't gone through anything like this.  Can anyone with experience advise Jo on what to expect, what to do, and what not to do?</span></div></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/vn/ask_ob_leaving_the_fold/">Ask OB: Leaving the Fold</a></p></body></html>
