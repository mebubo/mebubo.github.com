<html><head><title>Classic Sichuan in Millbrae, Thu Feb 21, 7pm</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>Classic Sichuan in Millbrae, Thu Feb 21, 7pm</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 15 February 2008 12:21AM</i></p><div><p><strong>Followup to</strong>:  <a href="0143.html">Bay Area Bayesians Unite</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/kl/bay_area_bayesians_unite/], <a href="0243.html">OB Meetup</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nd/ob_meetup_millbrae_thu_21_feb_7pm/]</p> <p>The Bay Area <em>Overcoming Bias</em> meetup will take place in the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/classic-sichuan-millbrae">Classic Sichuan restaurant</a> [http://www.yelp.com/biz/classic-sichuan-millbrae], 148 El Camino Real, Millbrae, CA 94031.  15 people said they would "Definitely" attend and an additional 27 said "Maybe".  Oh, and Robin Hanson will be there too.</p> <p>Dinner is scheduled for 7:00pm, on Thursday, February 21st, 2008.  I'll show up at 6:30pm, though, just to cut people some antislack if it's easier for them to arrive earlier.</p> <p>If you're arriving via the BART/Caltrain station, just walk up from the Southbound Caltrain side and turn right onto El Camino, walk a few meters, and you're there.</p> <p>If driving, I'd suggest taking the exit from 101 onto Millbrae Ave - the exit from 280 onto Millbrae surprisingly goes down a winding mountain road before arriving at downtown.  Doesn't mean you have to take 101 the whole way there, but I definitely recommend the 101 exit.</p><a id="more"></a><p>For parking, I would suggest parking near the BART/Caltrain station. From 101 onto Millbrae Ave., turn right onto El Camino, almost immediately pass the Peter's Cafe parking lot and then turn right onto a small street toward the train station.  The first parking lot you see on your right is reserved for Peter's Cafe, but immediately after that (still on your right) is some city parking that looked mostly empty when I visited last Thursday.  El Camino itself was parked up, though.  If all else fails, you should be able to park in the train station lots and pay a small fee. Then walk up to El Camino and turn right, as before.</p> <p>Classic Sichuan has vegetarian dishes.  They also have a reputation for their spicy food being <em>spicy,</em> so watch out!  I ate there to check quality, and while I'm generally a cultural barbarian, I didn't detect any problems with the food I was served.  Depending on how many people actually show up, we may overflow their small private room, but hopefully we won't overflow the restaurant.</p> <p>My cellphone number is (866) 983-5697.  That's toll-free, 866-YUDKOWS.</p> <p>Long live the Bayesian Conspiracy!  See you there!</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/nt/classic_sichuan_in_millbrae_thu_feb_21_7pm/">Classic Sichuan in Millbrae, Thu Feb 21, 7pm</a></p></body></html>
