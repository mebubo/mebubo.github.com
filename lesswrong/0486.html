Isn't that brilliant?  I wonder why they didn't <a href="http://www.futurecasts.com/Depression_descent-beginning-%2730.htm">think of that during the Great Depression</a> [http://www.futurecasts.com/Depression_descent-beginning-%2730.htm].</p> <p>However, I feel that this valiant effort does not go far enough.</p> <p><em>All</em> selling of stocks should be banned.  Once you buy a stock, you have to hold it forever.</p> <p>Sure, this might make the market a little less liquid.  But once stock prices can only go up, we'll all be rich!</p> <p>Or maybe we should just try something simpler: pass a law making it illegal for stock prices to go down.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/u4/ban_the_bear/">Ban the Bear</a></p></body></html>
