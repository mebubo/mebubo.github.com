Due to a technical mistake - I won't say which of us made it, except that it wasn't me - the video cuts out at 47:37, but the MP3 of the full dialogue is available <a href="http://download.bloggingheads.tv/completed/bhtv-2009-01-23-ww-ey.mp3">here</a> [http://download.bloggingheads.tv/completed/bhtv-2009-01-23-ww-ey.mp3].  I recall there was some good stuff at the end, too.</p><p>We talked about Obama up to 23 minutes, then it's on to rationality.
