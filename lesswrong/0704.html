Well... that <em>is</em> what decision theory is <em>for</em><em>.</em>  But also to <a href="0207.html">place a Go stone to block</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/md/cultish_countercultishness/] becoming a whining-based community.</p> <p>Let's be fair to <a href="0195.html">Ayn Rand</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/m1/guardians_of_ayn_rand/]:  There were legitimate messages in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> that many readers had never heard before, and this lent the book a part of its compelling power over them.  The message that <em>it's all right to excel</em>&#8212;that it's okay to be, <a href="0023.html">not just good, but better than others</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/h9/tsuyoku_vs_the_egalitarian_instinct/]&#8212;of this the Competitive Conspiracy would approve.</p> <p>But this is only part of Rand's message, and the other part is the poison pill, a deadlier appeal:  It's those looters who <em>don't </em>approve of excellence who are <em>keeping you down.</em>  Surely you would be rich and famous and high-status <em>like you deserve</em> if not for <em>them,</em> those unappreciative bastards and their conspiracy of mediocrity.</p> <p>If you consider the <em>reasonableness-based </em>conception of rationality rather than the <em>winning-based </em>conception of rationality&#8212;well, you can easily imagine some community of people congratulating themselves on how <em>reasonable</em> they were, while blaming the surrounding <em>unreasonable</em> society for keeping them down.  Wrapping themselves up in their own bitterness for reality refusing to comply with the greatness they thought they should have.</p> <p>But this is <em>not </em>how decision theory works&#8212;the "rational" strategy adapts to the other players' strategies, it does <em>not</em> depend on the other players being rational.  If a rational agent believes the other players are irrational then it takes that <em>expectation </em>into account in maximizing <em>expected</em> utility.  <a href="0681.html">Van Vogt</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/] got this one right: his rationalist protagonists are formidable from accepting reality swiftly and adapting to it swiftly, without reluctance or attachment.<a id="more"></a></p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping">Self-handicapping</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-handicapping] (hat-tip <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1d/simultaneously_right_and_wrong/">Yvain</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1d/simultaneously_right_and_wrong/]) is when people who have been made aware of their own incompetence or probable future failure, deliberately impose handicaps on themselves&#8212;on the standard model, in order to give themselves an <em>excuse</em> for failure.  To make sure they had an excuse, subjects reduced preparation times for athletic events, studied less, exerted less effort, gave opponents an advantage, lowered their own expectations, even took a drug they had been told was performance-inhibiting...</p> <p>So you can see how much people<em> value</em> having an excuse&#8212;how much they'll <em>pay</em> to make sure they have something outside themselves to blame, in case of failure.  And this is a need which many belief systems fill&#8212;they provide an <em>excuse.</em></p> <p>It's the government's fault, that taxes you and suppresses the economy&#8212;if it weren't for <em>that</em>, you would be a great entrepreneur.  It's the fault of those less competent who envy your excellence and slander you&#8212;if not for <em>that,</em> the whole world would pilgrimage to admire you.  It's racism, or sexism, that keeps you down&#8212;if it weren't for <em>that,</em> you would have gotten so much further in life with the same effort.  Your rival Bob got the promotion by bootlicking.  Those you call sinners may be much wealthier than you, but that's because God set up the system to reward the good deeds of the wicked in this world and punish them for their sins in the next, vice versa for the virtuous:  "A boor cannot know, nor can a fool understand this: when the wicked bloom like grass and all the doers of iniquity blossom&#8212;it is to destroy them till eternity."</p> <p>And maybe it's all true.  The government <em>does</em> impose taxes and barriers to new businesses.  There <em>is</em> racism and sexism.  Scientists <em>don't</em> run out and embrace new ideas without huge amounts of work to evangelize them.  Loyalty <em>is</em> a huge factor in promotions and flattery does signify loyalty.  I can't back religions on that divine plan thing, but still, those wealthier than you may have gotten there by means more vile than you care to use...</p> <p>And so what?  In other countries there are those with far greater obstacles and less opportunity than you.  There are those born with Down's Syndrome.  There's not a one of us in this world, even the <a href="http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2005/10/holodeck-scenario-part-i_23.html">luckiest</a> [http://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2005/10/holodeck-scenario-part-i_23.html], whose path is <em>entirely</em> straight and without obstacles.  In this unfair world, the test of your existence is how well you do in this unfair world.</p> <p>I <a href="0386.html">earlier</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rc/the_ultimate_source/] suggested that we view our parents and environment and genes as having determined <em>which</em> person makes a decision&#8212;plucking <em>you</em> out of Platonic person-space to agonize in front of the burning orphanage, rather than someone else&#8212;but<em> you</em> determine what that <em>particular</em> person decides.  If, counterfactually, your genes or environment had been different, then it would not so much <em>change your decision</em> as determine that <em>someone else would make</em> that decision.</p> <p>In the same sense, I would suggest that a baby with your genes, born into a universe entirely fair, would by now be such a different person that as to be nowhere close to "you", your point in Platonic person-space.  <em>You</em> are defined by the particular unfair challenges that you face; and the test of <em>your</em> existence is how well you do with them.</p> <p>And in that unfair challenge, the art of rationality (if you can find it) is there to help you deal with the horrible unfair challenge and by golly <em>win anyway,</em> not to provide fellow bitter losers to hang out with.  Even if the government <em>does</em> tax you and people <em>do </em>slander you and racists <em>do</em> discriminate against you and others smarm their way to success while you keep your ethics... still, this whole business of rationality is there to help you <em>win anyway, </em>if you can find the art you need.  Find the art together, win together, if we can.  And if we can't win, it means we weren't such good rationalists as we thought, and ought to try something different the next time around.  (If it's one of those challenges where you get more than one try.)</p> <p>From within that project&#8212;what good does a sense of <em>violated entitlement</em> do?  At all?  Ever?  What good does it do to tell ourselves that we did everything right and deserved better, and that someone or something else is to blame?  Is <em>that </em>the key thing we need to change, to do better next time?</p> <p>Immediate adaptation to the realities of the situation!  Followed by winning!</p> <p>That is how I would cast down the gauntlet, just to make really, really sure we don't go down the utterly, completely, pointlessly unhelpful, surprisingly common path of mutual bitterness and consolation.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="0726.html"><em>The Craft and the Community</em></a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/cz/the_craft_and_the_community/]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0706.html">Mandatory Secret Identities</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/9c/mandatory_secret_identities/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0699.html">Incremental Progress and the Valley</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/7k/incremental_progress_and_the_valley/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq16.html">Sequence 16: The Craft and the Community</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0699.html">Incremental Progress and the Valley</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0706.html">Mandatory Secret Identities</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0699.html">Incremental Progress and the Valley</a> &#8226; <a href="0706.html">Mandatory Secret Identities</a> &#8226; <a href="0726.html">The Craft and the Community</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/8t/whiningbased_communities/">Whining-Based Communities</a></p></body></html>
