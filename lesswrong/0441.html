On this day 63 years ago, humanity lost its nuclear virginity.  Until the end of time we will be a species that has used fission bombs in anger.</p> <p>Time has passed, and we still haven't blown up <a href="0345.html">our</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/q7/if_manyworlds_had_come_first/] world, despite a <a href="0112.html">close call</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/jq/926_is_petrov_day/] or two.  Which makes it difficult to criticize the decision - would things still have turned out all right, if anyone had chosen differently, anywhere along the way?</p> <p>Maybe we needed to see the <a href="http://www.lclark.edu/~history/HIROSHIMA/photo3-2.html">ruins</a> [http://www.lclark.edu/~history/HIROSHIMA/photo3-2.html], of the city and the people.</p> <p>Maybe we didn't.</p> <p>There's an ongoing debate - and no, it is not a settled issue - over whether the Japanese would have surrendered without the Bomb.  But I would not have dropped the Bomb even to save the lives of American soldiers, because I would have wanted to preserve that world where atomic weapons had never been used - to not cross that line.  I don't know about history to this point; but the world would be safer <em>now,</em> I think, <em>today,</em> if no one had ever used atomic weapons in war, and the idea was not considered suitable for polite discussion.</p> <p>I'm not saying it was wrong.  I don't know for certain that it was wrong.  I wouldn't have thought that humanity could make it this far without using atomic weapons again.  All I can say is that if it had been me, I wouldn't have done it.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/sv/hiroshima_day/">Hiroshima Day</a></p></body></html>
