It's not like there's some originally pure mode of thought, being tainted by only a small library of poisons.  It's just that there are exponentially more possible crazy thoughts than sane thoughts, c.f. entropy.</p> <p>But Stove's list of 39 different classic crazinesses applied to <em>the number three</em> is absolute pure epic gold.  (Scroll down about halfway through if you want to jump there directly.)</p> <p>I especially like #8:  "There is an integer between two and four, but it is not three, and its true name and nature are not to be revealed."</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fy/what_is_wrong_with_our_thoughts/">"What Is Wrong With Our Thoughts"</a></p></body></html>
