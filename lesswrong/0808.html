The much larger brain research community, in contrast, has been rapidly improving their ways to do fast cheap detailed 3D brain scans, and to prepare samples for such scans. You see, brain researchers need ways to stop brain samples from changing, and to be strong against scanning disruptions, just so they can study brain samples at their leisure.</span></p> <p style="border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #353537; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">These brain research techniques have now reached two key milestones:</p> <ol style="border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 40px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #353537; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;"> <li style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They&#8217;ve found new ways to &#8220;fix&#8221; brain samples by filling them with plastic, ways that seem impressively reliable, resilient, and long lasting, and which work on large brain volumes (e.g., <a style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #314c85; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" href="http://homes.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/~smikula/MIV.html?path=blockface/sm1329/&amp;width=97335&amp;height=152116&amp;notilegroups=1">here</a> [http://homes.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/~smikula/MIV.html?path=blockface/sm1329/&amp;width=97335&amp;height=152116&amp;notilegroups=1]). Such <a style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #314c85; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" href="http://www.gwern.net/plastination">plastination</a> [http://www.gwern.net/plastination] techniques seem close to being able to save enough info in entire brains for centuries, without needing continual care. Just dumping a plastic brain in a box in a closet might work fine.</li> <li style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Today, for a few tens of thousands of dollars, less than the price charged for one cryonics customer, it is feasible to have independent lab(s) take random samples from whole mouse or human brains preserved via either cryonics or plastination, and do high (5nm) resolution 3D scans to map out thousands of neighboring cells, their connections, and connection strengths, to test if either of these approaches clearly preserve such key brain info.</li> </ol> <p style="border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #353537; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">An anonymous donor has actually funded a $100K <a style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #314c85; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" href="http://brainpreservation.org/content/technology-prize">Brain Preservation Prize</a> [http://brainpreservation.org/content/technology-prize], paid to the first team(s) to pass this test on a human brain, with a quarter of the prize going to those that first pass the test on a mouse brain. Cryonics and plastination teams have already submitted whole mouse brains to be tested. The only hitch is that the prize organization needs money (~25-50K$) to actually do the tests!</p> </blockquote> <p style="border: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #353537; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 22px;">Comments?  If superior brain preservation can be demonstrated under a 5nm-resolution 3D scan, plastination wins over vitrification hands-down.  Is Robin missing anything here, or is this indeed as important as he says?</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/r/lesswrong/lw/d5u/plastination_is_maturing_and_needs_funding_says/">Plastination is maturing and needs funding, says Hanson</a></p></body></html>
