Is anyone interested in meeting up at the Symposium Cafe on 4 King St N, Waterloo, ON, Canada, on Sunday at 6pm on October 18th 2009?  I might duck out at around 8pm, but Michael Vassar seems more likely to stick around.  If we get at least two more positive reply comments (plus the one person who suggested the meetup) then it'll be on and I'll take the question mark off the title.  If that time doesn't work for you but you're in the area, feel free to email me about meeting informally.</p> <p><strong>Result:</strong>  Okay, we have exactly two people RSVPing (I was hoping for three).  We'll show up at the Symposium Cafe at 6pm, possibly walk around or head out to elsewhere by 6:30pm (i.e., join the meetup by 6:30pm if you want to be part of the walking-around group), and we've both got a talk we want to attend at 8:00pm.  Either stuff will happen, or not.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1bp/waterloo_on_canada_meetup_6pm_sun_oct_18_09/">Waterloo, ON, Canada Meetup: 6pm Sun Oct 18 '09!</a></p></body></html>
