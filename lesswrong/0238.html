Committees base their conclusions on a shared understanding of a common body of knowledge. Their members are drawn from an existing society of experts to evaluate the next incremental improvement. What do you do when there are no experts? Who lays claim to expertise in nanomedicine? Who has spent their life in this field which is just being conceived? No one. The committee process breaks down when we move into truly new terrain. It fails us just when failure is most expensive: at the beginnings of new things. Here we must fall back on individuals - individuals who are bold enough to believe in themselves when there are no experts to turn to for help and support. Individuals who are willing to back up their own beliefs with action, who will nurture the truly new and the truly groundbreaking without having to first seek the approval of others. For there are no others! On the far frontiers there are very few, and sometimes there is only one."<br>  &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; -- <a href="http://www.nanomedicine.com/afterword.html">Ralph Merkle</a> [http://www.nanomedicine.com/afterword.html], afterword to <em>Nanomedicine</em></span></p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/n8/rationality_quotes_9/">Rationality Quotes 9</a></p></body></html>
