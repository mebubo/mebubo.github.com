Still less do I think I have the ability to out-predict <em>markets</em>.  On every occasion when I've considered betting against a prediction market - most recently, betting against Barack Obama as President - I've been glad that I didn't.  I admit that I was concerned in advance about the recent complexity crash, but then I've been concerned about it since 1994, which isn't very good market timing.</p><p>I say all this so that no one panics when I ask:</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Suppose that the whole global economy goes the way of Japan (which, by the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EN225#chart1:symbol=%5En225;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">Nikkei 225</a> [http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EN225#chart1:symbol=%5En225;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined], has now lost <em>two</em> decades).</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Suppose the global economy is still in the Long Slump in 2039.</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">Most market participants seem to think this scenario is extremely implausible.  Is there a simple way to bet on it at a very low price?</p><p style="margin-left: 20px;">If most traders act as if this scenario has a probability of 1%, is there a simple bet, executable using an ordinary brokerage account, that pays off 100 to 1?</p><p>Why do I ask?  Well... in general, it seems to me that other people are not pessimistic enough; they prefer not to stare overlong or overhard into the dark; and they attach too little probability to things operating in a mode outside their past experience.</p><p>But in this <em>particular</em> case, the question is motivated by my thinking, "<em>Conditioning </em>on the proposition that the Earth as we know it is still here in 2040, what might have happened during the preceding thirty years?"</p> <a id="more"></a><p>There are many possible answers to this question, but one answer might take the form of significantly diminished investment in research and development, which in turn might result from a Long Slump.</p><p>So - given the way in which the question arises - I know nothing about this hypothetical Long Slump, except that it diminished investment in R&amp;D in general, and computing hardware and computer science in particular.</p><p>The Long Slump might happen for roughly Japanese reasons.  It might happen because the global financial sector stays screwed up forever.  It might happen due to a gentle version of Peak Oil (a total crash would require a rather different "investment strategy").  It might happen due to deglobalization.  Given the way in which the question arises, the only thing I want to assume is global stagnation for thirty years, saying nothing <a href="0106.html">burdensome</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/jk/burdensome_details/] about the particular causes.</p><p>What would be the most efficient way to bet on that, requiring the least initial investment for the highest and earliest payoff under the broadest Slump conditions?</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/xv/investing_for_the_long_slump/">Investing for the Long Slump</a></p></body></html>
