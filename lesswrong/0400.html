But suppose I <em>did</em> tell it to you.  Suppose that, whatever you think is the basis of your moral philosophy, I convincingly tore it apart, and moreover showed you that nothing could fill its place.  Suppose I <em>proved</em> that all utilities equaled zero.</p> <p>I know that Your-Moral-Philosophy is as true and undisprovable as <a href="0113.html">2 + 2 = 4</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/jr/how_to_convince_me_that_2_2_3/]. But still, I ask that you do your best to perform the thought experiment, and concretely envision the possibilities even if they seem painful, or pointless, or logically incapable of any good reply.</p> <p>Would you still tip cabdrivers?  Would you cheat on your Significant Other?  If a child lay fainted on the train tracks, would you still drag them off?</p> <p>Would you still eat the same kinds of foods&#8212;or would you only eat the cheapest food, since there's no reason you <em>should</em> have fun&#8212;or would you eat very expensive food, since there's no reason you <em>should</em> save money for tomorrow?</p> <p>Would you wear black and write gloomy poetry and denounce all altruists as fools?  But there's no reason you <em>should</em> do that&#8212;it's just a <a href="0127.html">cached thought</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/].</p> <p>Would you stay in bed because there was no reason to get up?  What about when you finally got hungry and stumbled into the kitchen&#8212;what would you do after you were done eating?</p> <p>Would you go on reading <em>Overcoming Bias,</em> and if not, what would you read instead?  Would you still try to be rational, and if not, what would you think instead?</p> <p>Close your eyes, take as long as necessary to answer:</p> <p>What <em>would</em> you do, if nothing were right?</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence"><em>The Metaethics Sequence</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rr/the_moral_void/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0398.html">2-Place and 1-Place Words</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ro/2place_and_1place_words/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq14.html">Sequence 14: Metaethics</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0398.html">2-Place and 1-Place Words</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0398.html">2-Place and 1-Place Words</a> &#8226; <a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/rq/what_would_you_do_without_morality/">What Would You Do Without Morality?</a></p></body></html>
