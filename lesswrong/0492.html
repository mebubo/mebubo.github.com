<html><head><title>The Level Above Mine</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>The Level Above Mine</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 26 September 2008 09:18AM</i></p><div><p><strong>Followup to</strong>:  <a href="0004.html">The Proper Use of Humility</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/gq/the_proper_use_of_humility/], <a href="0022.html">Tsuyoku Naritai</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/]</p> <p>(At this point, I fear that I must recurse into a subsequence; but if all goes as planned, it really <em>will</em> be short.)</p> <p>I once lent Xiaoguang "Mike" Li my copy of "Probability Theory: The Logic of Science".  Mike Li read some of it, and then came back and said:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Wow... it's like Jaynes is a thousand-year-old vampire."</p> </blockquote> <p>Then Mike said, "No, wait, let me explain that&#8212;" and I said, "No, I know exactly what you mean."  It's a convention in fantasy literature that the older a vampire gets, the more powerful they become.</p> <p>I'd enjoyed math proofs before I encountered Jaynes.  But E.T. Jaynes was the first time I picked up a sense of <em>formidability</em> from mathematical arguments.  Maybe because Jaynes was lining up "paradoxes" that had been used to object to Bayesianism, and then blasting them to pieces with overwhelming firepower&#8212;power being used to overcome others.  Or maybe the sense of formidability came from Jaynes not treating his math as a game of aesthetics; Jaynes <em>cared</em> about probability theory, it was bound up with other considerations that mattered, to him and to me too.</p> <p>For whatever reason, the sense I get of Jaynes is one of terrifying swift perfection&#8212;something that would arrive at the correct answer by the shortest possible route, tearing all surrounding mistakes to shreds in the same motion.  Of course, when you write a book, you get a chance to show only your best side.  But still.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>It spoke well of Mike Li that he was able to sense the aura of formidability surrounding Jaynes.  It's a general rule, I've observed, that you can't discriminate between levels too far above your own. E.g., someone once earnestly told me that I was really bright, and "ought to go to college".  Maybe anything more than around one standard deviation above you starts to blur together, though that's just a cool-sounding wild guess.</p> <p>So, having heard Mike Li compare Jaynes to a thousand-year-old vampire, one question immediately popped into my mind:</p> <p>"Do you get the same sense off me?" I asked.</p> <p>Mike shook his head.  "Sorry," he said, sounding somewhat awkward, "it's just that Jaynes is..."</p> <p>"No, I know," I said.  I hadn't thought I'd reached Jaynes's level. I'd only been curious about how I came across to other people.</p> <p>I <em>aspire</em> to Jaynes's level.  I <em>aspire</em> to become as much the master of Artificial Intelligence / reflectivity, as Jaynes was master of Bayesian probability theory.  I can even plead that the art I'm trying to master is more difficult than Jaynes's, making a mockery of deference.  Even so, and embarrassingly, there is <em>no</em> art of which I am as much the master now, as Jaynes was of probability theory.</p> <p>This is not, necessarily, to place myself beneath Jaynes as a person&#8212;to say that Jaynes had a <a href="0366.html">magical aura of destiny</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/qs/einsteins_superpowers/], and I don't.</p> <p>Rather I recognize in Jaynes <em>a level of expertise, of sheer formidability,</em> which I have not yet achieved.  I can argue forcefully in my chosen subject, but that is not the same as writing out the equations and saying:<strong>  DONE.</strong></p> <p>For so long as I have not yet achieved that level, I must acknowledge the possibility that I can never achieve it, that my native talent is not sufficient.  When Marcello Herreshoff had known me for long enough, I asked him if he knew of anyone who struck him as substantially more <em>natively intelligent</em> than myself.  Marcello thought for a moment and said "John Conway&#8212;I met him at a summer math camp."  <em>Darn,</em> I thought, <em>he thought of someone, and worse, it's some ultra-famous old guy I can't grab.</em>  I inquired how Marcello had arrived at the judgment.  Marcello said, "He just struck me as having a tremendous amount of mental horsepower," and started to explain a math problem he'd had a chance to work on with Conway.</p> <p>Not what I wanted to hear.</p> <p>Perhaps, relative to Marcello's experience of Conway and his experience of me, I haven't had a chance to show off on any subject that I've mastered as thoroughly as Conway had mastered his many fields of mathematics.</p> <p>Or it might be that Conway's brain is specialized off in a different direction from mine, and that I could never approach Conway's level on math, yet Conway wouldn't do so well on AI research.</p> <p>Or...</p> <p>...or I'm strictly dumber than Conway, dominated by him along all dimensions.  Maybe, if I could find a young proto-Conway and tell them the basics, they would blaze right past me, solve the problems that have weighed on me for years, and zip off to places I can't follow.</p> <p>Is it damaging to my ego to confess that last possibility?  Yes.  It would be futile to deny that.</p> <p>Have I <em>really</em> accepted that awful possibility, or am I only pretending to myself to have accepted it?  Here I will say:  "No, I think I have accepted it."  Why do I dare give myself so much credit?  Because I've invested specific effort into that awful possibility.  I am blogging here for many reasons, but a major one is the vision of some younger mind reading these words and zipping off past me.  It might happen, it might not.</p> <p>Or sadder:  Maybe I just wasted too much time on setting up the resources to support me, instead of studying math full-time through my whole youth; or I wasted too much youth on non-mathy ideas.  And this choice, my past, is irrevocable.  I'll hit a brick wall at 40, and there won't be anything left but to pass on the resources to another mind with the potential I wasted, still young enough to learn.  So to save them time, I should leave a trail to my successes, and post warning signs on my mistakes.</p> <p>Such <em>specific efforts</em> predicated on an ego-damaging possibility&#8212;that's the only kind of humility that seems real enough for me to dare credit myself.  Or giving up my precious theories, when I realized that they didn't meet the standard Jaynes had shown me&#8212;that was hard, and it was real.  <a href="0004.html">Modest demeanors are cheap</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/gq/the_proper_use_of_humility/].  <a href="0061.html">Humble admissions of doubt are cheap</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ib/the_proper_use_of_doubt/].
