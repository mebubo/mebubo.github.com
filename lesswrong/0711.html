Cut, staple in the middle (using a large-sized, measuring stapler), and fold.  This method is <em>very</em> cheap, probably something like ten cents a copy for ink and paper.  But it produces crappy-looking pamphlets.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a way of cheaply printing small 16-page pamphlets?  Take a look at the <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/assets/pdf/twelve_virtues.pdf">pamphlet</a> [http://yudkowsky.net/assets/pdf/twelve_virtues.pdf] to see the current size.  I would really like to see the pamphlets stack well so I can plump down 50 of them without the tower falling over, which is the main problem with the staple-and-fold method.  But even more important is that they be <em>cheap,</em> considering the quantities in which I hand these out for free.  Something conducive to a professional-looking cover (i.e. allowing for the top sheet to be glossy or a higher quality of paper) would also be nice, again cost permitting.</p> <p>If I can find a good solution I'll also go ahead and get the pamphlet graphically redesigned before printing, of course, and include some more direct proselytizing material for <em>Less Wrong</em> on the back cover.</p> <p>I've looked around online, but all the print shops I've seen have been way too expensive for giving away 200 copies per convention - even by myself, much less getting other people to do it on a routine basis.  Does anyone know how to get this done cheaply?  A minimum order of 10,000 for $1000 would be quite acceptable - I expect at that price I could ship some boxes to other LWers.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ak/twelve_virtues_booklet_printing/">Twelve Virtues booklet printing?</a></p></body></html>
