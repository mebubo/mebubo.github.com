So a bailout bill makes an expected difference of 2000 points on the Dow.</p> <p>Of course this is a bogus calculation, but it's an interesting one.  Not overwhelmingly on-topic for OB, but it involves prediction markets and I didn't see anyone else pointing it out.  I hope the bailout fails decisively, so this calculation can be tested.</p><a id="more"></a><p><strong>PS:</strong>  <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/09/how_would_we_kn.html">Bryan Caplan understands Bayes's Rule</a> [http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/09/how_would_we_kn.html]:  It's not possible for both A and ~A to be evidence in favor of B.  So which of the two possibilities, "unemployment stays under 8% following a bailout" and "unemployment goes over 8% following a bailout", is evidence for the proposition "the bailout was necessary to prevent economic catastrophe", and which is evidence against?  Take your stand now; afterward is too late for us to trust your reasoning.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ug/intrade_and_the_dow_drop/">Intrade and the Dow Drop</a></p></body></html>
