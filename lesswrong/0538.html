Those are your <a href="0114.html">only real reasons</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/], nor is it possible to arrive at a real reason in any other way.</p> <p>And this is also writing advice: because I have sometimes been approached by people who say "How do I convince people to wear green shoes?  I don't know how to argue it," and I reply, "Ask yourself honestly whether you should wear green shoes; then make a list of which thoughts actually move you to decide one way or another; then figure out how to explain or argue them, recursing as necessary."</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/vk/back_up_and_ask_whether_not_why/">Back Up and Ask Whether, Not Why</a></p></body></html>
