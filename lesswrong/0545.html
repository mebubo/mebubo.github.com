The next one is 8PM, November 17th, 2008 (Monday night) in Menlo Park at TechShop.  (Note that this is a room with seating, not a restaurant, so we hopefully get a chance to actually <em>talk</em> to each other - though I'll try to stay in the background myself.)</p> <p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Overcoming-Bias-Meetup/calendar/9032907/">RSVP at Meetup.com.</a> [http://www.meetup.com/Bay-Area-Overcoming-Bias-Meetup/calendar/9032907/]</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/vr/bay_area_meetup_1117_8pm_menlo_park/">Bay Area Meetup: 11/17 8PM Menlo Park</a></p></body></html>
