What is it, exactly, that goes in this catalogue?  Besides rainbows, that is?</p> <p>Why, things that are mundane, of course.  Things that are normal; things that are unmagical; things that are known, or knowable; things that play by the rules (or that play by <em>any</em> rules, which makes them boring); things that are part of the ordinary universe; things that are, in a word, <em>real.</em></p> <p>Now that's what I call setting yourself up for a fall.</p> <p>At that rate, sooner or later you're going to be disappointed in <em>everything</em>&#8212;either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse, it will turn out to be real.</p> <p>If we cannot take joy in things that are merely real, our lives will <em>always</em> be empty.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>For what sin are rainbows demoted to the dull catalogue of common things?  For the sin of having a scientific explanation.  "We know her woof, her texture", says Keats&#8212;an interesting use of the word "we", because I <a href="0291.html">suspect that Keats didn't know</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/op/fake_reductionism/] the explanation himself.  I suspect that just being <a href="0089.html">told that someone else knew</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j3/science_as_curiositystopper/] was too much for him to take.  I suspect that just the notion of rainbows being scientifically explicable <em>in principle</em> would have been too much to take.  And if Keats didn't think like that, well, I know plenty of people who do.</p> <p>I have already remarked that nothing is <em>inherently</em> <a href="0080.html">mysterious</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/iu/mysterious_answers_to_mysterious_questions/]&#8212;nothing that actually exists, that is.  If I am <a href="0285.html">ignorant</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/] about a phenomenon, that is <a href="0284.html">a fact about my state of mind</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/], not a fact about the phenomenon; to <a href="0088.html">worship</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j2/explainworshipignore/] a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious, is to worship your own ignorance; a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory, it is just somewhere we haven't visited yet, etc. etc...</p> <p>Which is to say that <em>everything</em>&#8212;everything that <em>actually </em>exists&#8212;is liable to end up in "the dull catalogue of common things", sooner or later.</p> <p>Your choice is either:</p> <ul> <li>Decide that things are allowed to be unmagical, knowable, scientifically explicable, in a word, <em>real,</em> and yet still worth caring about;</li> <li>Or go about the rest of your life suffering from existential ennui that is <em>unresolvable.</em></li> </ul> <p>(Self-deception might be an option for others, but <a href="0100.html">not for you</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/je/doublethink_choosing_to_be_biased/].)</p> <p>This puts quite a different complexion on the bizarre habit indulged by those strange folk called <em>scientists,</em> wherein they suddenly become fascinated by pocket lint or bird droppings or rainbows, or some other ordinary thing which world-weary and sophisticated folk would never give a second glance.</p> <p>You might say that scientists&#8212;at least <em>some </em>scientists&#8212;are those folk who are <em>in principle</em> capable of enjoying life in the real universe.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Joy_in_the_Merely_Real"><em>Joy in the Merely Real</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Joy_in_the_Merely_Real] subsequence of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_%28sequence%29"><em>Reductionism</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_%28sequence%29]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0294.html">Joy in Discovery</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/os/joy_in_discovery/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0292.html">Savanna Poets</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/oq/savanna_poets/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq18.html">Sequence 18: Joy in the Merely Real</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="seq17.html">Sequence 17: Highly Advanced Epistemology 101 for Beginners</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0294.html">Joy in Discovery</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0292.html">Savanna Poets</a> &#8226; <a href="0294.html">Joy in Discovery</a> &#8226; <a href="0295.html">Bind Yourself to Reality</a> &#8226; <a href="0296.html">If You Demand Magic, Magic Won't Help</a> &#8226; <a href="0298.html">The Beauty of Settled Science</a> &#8226; <a href="0304.html">Hand vs. Fingers</a> &#8226; <a href="0373.html">Living in Many Worlds</a> &#8226; <a href="0379.html">The Quantum Physics Sequence</a> &#8226; <a href="0381.html">Quantum Physics Revealed As Non-Mysterious</a> &#8226; <a href="0391.html">Heading Toward Morality</a> &#8226; <a href="0415.html">Rebelling Within Nature</a> &#8226; <a href="0420.html">The Gift We Give To Tomorrow</a> &#8226; <a href="0422.html">Existential Angst Factory</a> &#8226; <a href="0430.html">Changing Your Metaethics</a> &#8226; <a href="0431.html">Setting Up Metaethics</a> &#8226; <a href="0477.html">Excluding the Supernatural</a> &#8226; <a href="0532.html">Mundane Magic</a> &#8226; <a href="0674.html">Raising the Sanity Waterline</a> &#8226; <a href="0688.html">The Sacred Mundane</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/or/joy_in_the_merely_real/">Joy in the Merely Real</a></p></body></html>
