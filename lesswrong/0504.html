Not just for Singularitarians, all aspiring rationalists are welcome. From the replies so far it's likely to be in <a href="http://sanjose.org/">San Jose</a> [http://sanjose.org/].</p> <p>Eliezer, myself and probably most Summit attendees would really rather avoid the night between the Friday Workshop and Saturday Summit, so maybe either Saturday evening or sometime Thursday or Sunday? </p> <p>Please comment below or email me (cursor_loop 4t yahoo p0int com) if you might want to come, and if you have any preferences such as when and where you <em>can</em> come, when and where you'd <em>prefer</em> to come, and any recommendations for a particular place to go.  (Comments preferred to emails.) We need to pick a date ASAP before everyone books travel.</p></blockquote></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0524.html">San Jose Meetup, Sat 10/25 @ 7:30pm</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/um/bay_area_meetup_for_singularity_summit/">Bay Area Meetup for Singularity Summit</a></p></body></html>
