Or an adminstrator such as myself or Robin (by default you should bother me) can temporarily bless you with posting ability - in the long run this shouldn't happen much.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/w/posting_now_enabled/">Posting now enabled</a></p></body></html>
