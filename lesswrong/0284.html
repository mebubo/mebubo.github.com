Oddly enough, the aliens never go after men in torn shirts.</p> <p>Would a non-humanoid alien, with a different evolutionary history and <a href="0159.html">evolutionary psychology</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/l1/evolutionary_psychology/], sexually desire a human female?  It seems rather unlikely.  To put it mildly.</p> <p>People don't make mistakes like that by deliberately reasoning:  "All possible minds are likely to be wired pretty much the same way, therefore a bug-eyed monster will find human females attractive."  Probably the artist did not even think to ask whether an alien <em>perceives</em> human females as attractive.  Instead, a human female in a torn dress <em>is sexy</em>&#8212;inherently so, as an intrinsic property.</p> <p>They who went astray did not think about the alien's evolutionary history; they focused on the woman's torn dress.  If the dress were not torn, the woman would be less sexy; the alien monster doesn't enter into it.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>Apparently we instinctively represent Sexiness as a direct attribute of the Woman object, <tt>Woman.sexiness</tt>, like <tt>Woman.height</tt> or <tt>Woman.weight</tt>.</p> <p>If your brain uses that data structure, or something metaphorically similar to it, then <a href="0254.html">from the inside</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/] it feels like sexiness is an inherent property of the woman, not a property of the alien looking at the woman.  Since the woman <em>is attractive,</em> the alien monster will be <em>attracted</em> to her&#8212;isn't that logical?</p> <p>E. T. Jaynes used the term <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/6330.html">Mind Projection Fallacy</a> [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/6330.html] to denote the error of projecting your own mind's properties into the external world.  Jaynes, as a late grand master of the Bayesian Conspiracy, was most concerned with the mistreatment of <em>probabilities </em>as inherent properties of objects, rather than states of partial knowledge in some particular mind.  More about this shortly.</p> <p>But the Mind Projection Fallacy generalizes as an error.  It is in the argument over <a href="0255.html">the real meaning of the word sound</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/np/disputing_definitions/], and in the magazine cover of the monster carrying off a woman in the torn dress, and Kant's declaration that space by its very nature is flat, and Hume's definition of <a href="0124.html">a priori</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/k2/a_priori/] ideas as those "discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is anywhere existent in the universe"...</p> <p>(Incidentally, I once read an SF story about a human male who entered into a sexual relationship with a sentient alien plant of appropriately squishy fronds; discovered that it was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sexuality">androecious</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_sexuality] (male) plant; agonized about this for a bit; and finally decided that it didn't really matter at that point.  And in Foglio and Pollotta's <em>Illegal Aliens,</em> the humans land on a planet inhabited by sentient insects, and see a movie advertisement showing a human carrying off a bug in a delicate chiffon dress.  Just thought I'd mention that.)</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_%28sequence%29"><em>Reductionism</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_%28sequence%29]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0285.html">Probability is in the Mind</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/oj/probability_is_in_the_mind/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0283.html">Righting a Wrong Question</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/oh/righting_a_wrong_question/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq12.html">Sequence 12: Reductionism</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0283.html">Righting a Wrong Question</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0285.html">Probability is in the Mind</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0283.html">Righting a Wrong Question</a> &#8226; <a href="0285.html">Probability is in the Mind</a> &#8226; <a href="0286.html">The Quotation is not the Referent</a> &#8226; <a href="0288.html">Qualitatively Confused</a> &#8226; <a href="0289.html">Reductionism</a> &#8226; <a href="0290.html">Explaining vs. Explaining Away</a> &#8226; <a href="0293.html">Joy in the Merely Real</a> &#8226; <a href="0304.html">Hand vs. Fingers</a> &#8226; <a href="0314.html">Quantum Explanations</a> &#8226; <a href="0315.html">Configurations and Amplitude</a> &#8226; <a href="0328.html">The So-Called Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</a> &#8226; <a href="0335.html">Decoherent Essences</a> &#8226; <a href="0339.html">Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"</a> &#8226; <a href="0360.html">Mach's Principle: Anti-Epiphenomenal Physics</a> &#8226; <a href="0362.html">Relative Configuration Space</a> &#8226; <a href="0363.html">Timeless Physics</a> &#8226; <a href="0374.html">Thou Art Physics</a> &#8226; <a href="0385.html">Possibility and Could-ness</a> &#8226; <a href="0388.html">Grasping Slippery Things</a> &#8226; <a href="0391.html">Heading Toward Morality</a> &#8226; <a href="0397.html">No Universally Compelling Arguments</a> &#8226; <a href="0398.html">2-Place and 1-Place Words</a> &#8226; <a href="0431.html">Setting Up Metaethics</a> &#8226; <a href="0432.html">The Meaning of Right</a> &#8226; <a href="0434.html">Humans in Funny Suits</a> &#8226; <a href="0439.html">Anthropomorphic Optimism</a> &#8226; <a href="0443.html">Inseparably Right; or, Joy in the Merely Good</a> &#8226; <a href="0459.html">Magical Categories</a> &#8226; <a href="0460.html">Three Fallacies of Teleology</a> &#8226; <a href="0465.html">Dreams of Friendliness</a> &#8226; <a href="0477.html">Excluding the Supernatural</a> &#8226; <a href="0522.html">Which Parts Are "Me"?</a> &#8226; <a href="0565.html">Chaotic Inversion</a> &#8226; <a href="0574.html">Artificial Mysterious Intelligence</a> &#8226; <a href="0629.html">Value is Fragile</a> &#8226; <a href="0674.html">Raising the Sanity Waterline</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/oi/mind_projection_fallacy/">Mind Projection Fallacy</a></p></body></html>
