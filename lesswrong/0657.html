This worked surprisingly well (and I would recommend it for future meetups).</p> <p>I think I've already told enough of my own origin story on <em>Overcoming Bias:</em> how I was digging in my parents' yard as a kid and found a tarnished silver amulet inscribed with Bayes's Theorem, and how I wore it to bed that night and dreamed of a woman in white, holding an ancient leather-bound book called <em>Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</em> (eds. D. Kahneman, P. Slovic, and A. Tversky, 1982)... but there's no need to go into that again.</p> <p>So, seriously... how did <em>you </em>originally go down that road?</p> <p><strong>Added:</strong>  For some odd reason, many of the commenters here seem to have had a single experience in common - namely, at some point, encountering <em>Overcoming Bias</em><em>...</em>  But I'm especially interested in what it takes to get the transition <em>started </em>- crossing the <em>first </em>divide.  This would be very valuable knowledge if it can be generalized.  If that did happen at <em>OB,</em> please try to specify what was the crucial "Aha!" insight (down to the specific post if possible).</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0659.html">Tell Your Rationalist Origin Story... at Less Wrong</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2/tell_your_rationalist_origin_story/">Tell Your Rationalist Origin Story</a></p></body></html>
