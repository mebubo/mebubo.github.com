We're going to make heavy use of polarized photons here, so you'd better have read <a href="0337.html">yesterday's post</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pz/decoherence_as_projection/].</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>If a particle at rest decays into two other particles, their <em>net</em> momentum must add up to 0.  The two new particles may have amplitudes to head off in all directions, but in each <em>joint</em> configuration, the directions will be opposite.</p> <p>By a similar method you can produce two entangled photons which head off in opposite directions, and are guaranteed to be polarized oppositely (at right angles to each other), but with a 50% prior probability of going through any given polarized filter.</p> <p>You might think that this would involve amplitudes over a continuous spectrum of opposite configurations&#8212;an amplitude for photon A to be polarized at 0&#176; and for photon B to be polarized at 90&#176;, an amplitude for A to be 1&#176; polarized and for B to be 91&#176; polarized, etc.  But in fact it's possible to describe the quantum state "unknown but opposite polarizations" much more compactly.</p> <p>First, note that the two photons are heading off in opposite directions.  This justifies calling one photon A and one photon B; they aren't likely to get their <a href="0319.html">identities</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/] mixed up.</p> <p>As with yesterday, the polarization state (1 ; 0) is what passes a 90&#176; filter.  The polarization state (0 ; 1) is what passes a 0&#176; filter.  (1 ; 0) is polarized up-down, (0 ; 1) is polarized left-right.</p> <p>If A is in the polarization state (1 ; 0), we'll write that as A=(1 ; 0).</p> <p>If A=(1 ; 0) and B=(0 ; 1), we'll write that as</p> <blockquote> <p>[ A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ]</p> </blockquote> <p>The state for "unknown opposite polarization" can be written as:</p> <blockquote> <p>&#8730;(1/2) * ( [ A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] - [ A=(0 ; 1) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that both terms are being multiplied by the square root of 1/2.  This ensures that the squared modulus of both terms sums to 1. Also, don't overlook the minus sign in the center, we'll need it.</p> <p>If you measure the A photon's polarization in the up-down/left-right basis, the result is pretty straightforward.  Your measurement decoheres the entanglement, creating one evolution out of the A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) configuration, and a second, noninteracting evolution out of the A=(0 ; 1) &#8743; B=(1; 0) configuration.</p> <p>If you find that the A photon is polarized up-down, i.e., (1 ; 0), then you know you're in the A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) blob of amplitude. So you know that if you or anyone else measures B, they'll report to you that they found B in the (0 ; 1) or left-right polarization.  The version of you that finds A=(1 ; 0), and the version of your friend that finds B=(0 ; 1), always turn out to live in the same blob of amplitude.</p> <p>On the other side of <a href="0321.html">configuration space</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pj/the_quantum_arena/], another version of you finds themselves in the A=(0 ; 1) &#8743; B=(1; 0) blob.  If a friend measures B, the other you will expect to hear that B was polarized up-down, just as you expect to meet the version of your friend that measured B left-right.</p> <p>But what if you measure the system in a slanted basis&#8212;test a photon with a 30&#176; polarized filter?  Given the specified starting state, in the up-down / left-right basis, what happens if we measure in the 30&#176; basis instead?  Will we still find the photons having opposite polarizations?  Can this be demonstrated?</p> <p>Yes, but the math gets a little more interesting.</p> <p>Let's review, from yesterday, the case where a photon previously polarized in the up-down/left-right basis encounters a 30&#176; filter.</p> <p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/02/polar3060.png"><img src="00e0930b.png" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" title="Polar3060" height="235" width="250" alt="Polar3060" border="0"></a> [http://lesswrong.com/static/imported/2008/05/02/polar3060.png] A 30-60-90 triangle has a hypotenuse of 1, a small side of 1/2, and a longer side of (&#8730;3)/2, in accordance with the Pythagorean Theorem.</p> <p>If a photon passes a 0&#176; filter, coming out with polarization (0 ; 1), and then encounters another filter at 30&#176;, the vector that would be <em>transmitted </em>through the 30&#176; filter is</p> <blockquote> <p>(&#8730;3)/2 * (1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) = (.433 ; .75)</p> </blockquote> <p>and the polarization vector that would be <em>absorbed</em> is</p> <blockquote> <p>1/2 * (-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) = (-.433 ; .25)</p> </blockquote> <p>Note that the polarization states (1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) and (-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) form an <em>orthonormal basis:</em>  The <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/#VecVecSpa">inner product</a> [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/#VecVecSpa] of each vector with itself is 1, and the inner product of the two vectors with each other is 0.</p> <p>Then we had (&#8730;3)/2 of one basis vector plus 1/2 of the other, guaranteeing the squared moduli would sum to 1.  ((&#8730;3)/2)<sup>2</sup>  + (1/2)<sup>2</sup>  = 3/4 + 1/4 = 1.</p> <p>So we can say that in the 30&#176; basis, the incoming (0 ; 1) photon had a (&#8730;3)/2 amplitude to be transmitted, and a 1/2 amplitude to be absorbed.</p> <p>Symmetrically, suppose a photon had passed a 90&#176; filter, coming out with polarization (1 ; 0), and then encountered the same 30&#176; filter.  Then the transmitted vector would be</p> <blockquote> <p>1/2 * (1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) = (.25 ; .433)</p> </blockquote> <p>and the absorbed vector would be</p> <blockquote> <p>-(&#8730;3)/2 * (-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) = (.75 ; -.433)</p> </blockquote> <p>Now let's consider again with the entangled pair of photons</p> <blockquote> <p>&#8730;(1/2) * ( [ A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] - [ A=(0 ; 1) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )</p> </blockquote> <p>and measure photon A with a 30&#176; filter.</p> <p>Suppose we find that we see photon A absorbed.</p> <p>Then we know that there was a -(&#8730;3)/2 amplitude for this event to occur if the original state had A=(1 ; 0), and a 1/2 amplitude for this event to occur if the original state had A=(0 ; 1).</p> <p>So, if we see that photon A is absorbed, we learn that <em>we</em> are in the now-decoherent blob of amplitude:</p> <blockquote> <p>( -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] )<br>- ( 1/2 * &#8730;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )</p> </blockquote> <p>You might be tempted to add the two amplitudes for A being absorbed&#8212;the -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) and the -1/2 * &#8730;(1/2)&#8212;and get a total amplitude of -.966, which, squared, comes out as .933.</p> <p>But if this were true, there would be a 93% prior probability of A being absorbed by the filter&#8212;a huge prior expectation to see it absorbed.  There should be a 50% prior chance of seeing A absorbed.</p> <p>What went wrong is that, even though we haven't yet measured B, the configurations with B=(0 ; 1) and B=(1 ; 0) are <a href="0317.html">distinct</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pf/distinct_configurations/]. B could be light-years away, and unknown to us; the configurations would still be distinct.  So we don't add the amplitudes for the two terms; we keep them separate.</p> <p>When the amplitudes for the terms are <em>separately</em> squared, and the squares added together, we get a prior absorption probability of 1/2&#8212;which is exactly what we should expect.</p> <p>Okay, so we're in the decoherent blob where A is absorbed by a 30&#176; filter.  Now consider what happens over at B, within our blob, if a friend measures B with another 30&#176; filter.</p> <p>The new starting amplitude distribution is:</p> <blockquote> <p>( -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] )<br>- ( 1/2 * &#8730;(1/2) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )</p> </blockquote> <p>In the case where B=(0 ; 1), it has an amplitude of (&#8730;3)/2 to be transmitted through a 30&#176; filter; being transmitted through a 30&#176; filter corresponds to the polarization state (1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2).  Likewise, a 1/2 amplitude to be absorbed (polarization state (-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2).)</p> <p>In the case where B=(1 ; 0) it has an amplitude of 1/2 to be transmitted with state (1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2).  And an amplitude of -(&#8730;3)/2 to occupy the state (-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) and be absorbed.</p> <p>So add up four terms:</p> <blockquote> <p>( -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] <br><em>  breaks down into</em><br>    ( -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) * (&#8730;3)/2 * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) ] +<br>    ( -(&#8730;3)/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) * 1/2  &#160;&#160; * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) ]<br><em>and</em><br>- ( 1/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )<br><em>   breaks down into</em><br>&#160;&#160; -( 1/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) *  1/2  &#160;&#160;  * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) ] +<br>&#160;&#160; -( 1/2 * &#8730;(1/2) ) * -(&#8730;3)/2 * [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) ]</p> </blockquote> <p>These four terms occupy only two distinct configurations.</p> <p>Adding the amplitudes, the configuration [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) ] ends up with zero amplitude, while [ A=(-(&#8730;3)/2 ; 1/2) &#8743; B=(1/2 ; (&#8730;3)/2) ] ends up with a final amplitude of &#8730;(1/2).</p> <p>So, within the blob in which you've found yourself, the probability of your friend seeing that a 30&#176; filter blocks both A and B, is 0.  The probability of seeing that a 30&#176; filter blocks A and transmits B, is 50%.</p> <p>Symmetrically, there's another blob of amplitude where your other self sees A transmitted and B blocked, with probability 50%.  And A transmitted and B transmitted, with probability 0%.</p> <p>So you and your friend, when you compare results in some particular blob of decohered amplitude, always find that the two photons have opposite polarization.</p> <p>And in general, if you use two equally oriented polarization filters to measure a pair of photons in the inital state:</p> <blockquote> <p>&#8730;(1/2) * ( [ A=(1 ; 0) &#8743; B=(0 ; 1) ] - [ A=(0 ; 1) &#8743; B=(1; 0) ] )</p> </blockquote> <p>then you are guaranteed that one filter will transmit, and the other filter absorb&#8212;regardless of how you set the filters, so long as you use the same setting.  The photons <em>always</em> have opposite polarizations, even though the prior probability of any <em>particular</em> photon having a <em>particular</em> polarization is 50%.</p> <p>What if I measure one photon with a 0&#176; filter, and find that it is transmitted (= state (0 ; 1)), and then I measure the other photon with a 30&#176; filter?</p> <p>The probability works out to just the same as if I knew the other photon had state (1 ; 0)&#8212;in effect, it now does.</p> <p>Over on my side, I've decohered the amplitude over the <em>joint</em> distribution, into blobs in which A has been transmitted, and A absorbed.  I am in the decoherent blob with A transmitted:  A=(0 ; 1). Ergo, the amplitude vector / polarization state of B, <em>in my blob,</em> behaves as if it starts out as (1 ; 0).  This is just as true whether I measure it with another 0&#176; filter, or a 30&#176; filter.</p> <p>With symmetrically entangled particles, each particle <em>seems</em> to know the state the other particle has been measured in.  But "seems" is the operative word here.  Actually we're just dealing with decoherence that happens to take place in a very symmetrical way.</p> <p>Tomorrow (if all goes according to plan) we'll look at Bell's Theorem, which rules out the possibility that each photon already has a fixed, non-quantum state that locally determines the result of any possible polarization measurement.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of <a href="0379.html"><em>The Quantum Physics Sequence</em></a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/r5/the_quantum_physics_sequence/]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0339.html">Bell's Theorem: No EPR 'Reality'</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/q1/bells_theorem_no_epr_reality/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0337.html">Decoherence as Projection</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pz/decoherence_as_projection/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq13.html">Sequence 13: Quantum Physics</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0337.html">Decoherence as Projection</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0339.html">Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0337.html">Decoherence as Projection</a> &#8226; <a href="0339.html">Bell's Theorem: No EPR "Reality"</a> &#8226; <a href="0340.html">Spooky Action at a Distance: The No-Communication Theorem</a> &#8226; <a href="0379.html">The Quantum Physics Sequence</a> &#8226; <a href="0380.html">An Intuitive Explanation of Quantum Mechanics</a> &#8226; <a href="0381.html">Quantum Physics Revealed As Non-Mysterious</a> &#8226; <a href="0382.html">And the Winner is...
