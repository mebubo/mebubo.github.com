He took cash out of the mortgage (applied for larger amounts than the price of the house) and spent the money on living expenses and real-estate seminars.  He was expecting the market to go up, it seems.</p> <p>That's not even the sad part.  The sad part is that <em>he still hasn't given up.</em>  Casey Serin does not accept defeat.  He refuses to declare bankruptcy, or get a job; he <a href="http://iamfacingforeclosure.com/147/top-5-advice-they-say-i-have-been-ignoring-2/">still thinks</a> [http://iamfacingforeclosure.com/147/top-5-advice-they-say-i-have-been-ignoring-2/] he can make it big in real estate.  He went on spending money on seminars.  He tried to take out a mortgage on a 9th house.  He hasn't <em>failed,</em> you see, he's just had a <em>learning experience.</em></p> <p>That's what happens when you refuse to lose hope.</p> <p>While this behavior may seem to be merely stupid, it also puts me in mind of two Nobel-Prize-winning economists...</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>...namely Merton and Scholes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management].</p> <p>While LTCM raked in giant profits over its first three years, in 1998 the inefficiences that LTCM were exploiting had started to vanish&#8212;other people knew about the trick, so it stopped working.</p> <p>LTCM refused to lose hope.  Addicted to 40% annual returns, they borrowed more and more leverage to exploit tinier and tinier margins.  When everything started to go wrong for LTCM, they had equity of $4.72 billion, leverage of $124.5 billion, and derivative positions of $1.25 trillion.</p> <p>Every profession has a different way to be smart&#8212;different skills to learn and rules to follow.  You might therefore think that the study of "rationality", as a general discipline, wouldn't have much to contribute to real-life success.  And yet it seems to me that <em>how to not be stupid</em> has a great deal in common across professions.  If you set out to teach someone <em>how to not turn little mistakes into big mistakes</em>, it's nearly the same art whether in hedge funds or romance, and one of the keys is this:  Be ready to admit you lost.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#Letting_Go"><em>Letting Go</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#Letting_Go] subsequence of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind"><em>How To Actually Change Your Mind</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0061.html">The Proper Use of Doubt</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ib/the_proper_use_of_doubt/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0094.html">The Crackpot Offer</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j8/the_crackpot_offer/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq10.html">Sequence 10: Letting Go</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0094.html">The Crackpot Offer</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0061.html">The Proper Use of Doubt</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0029.html">Debiasing as Non-Self-Destruction</a> &#8226; <a href="0061.html">The Proper Use of Doubt</a> &#8226; <a href="0094.html">The Crackpot Offer</a> &#8226; <a href="0505.html">On Doing the Impossible</a> &#8226; <a href="0640.html">...And Say No More Of It</a> &#8226; <a href="0664.html">Unteachable Excellence</a> &#8226; <a href="0749.html">Unspeakable Morality</a> &#8226; <a href="0823.html">Godel's Completeness and Incompleteness Theorems</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gx/just_lose_hope_already/">Just Lose Hope Already</a></p></body></html>
