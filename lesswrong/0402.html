If you have not yet read this ancient classic, consider doing so now.</p> <p>The Tortoise offers Achilles a step of reasoning drawn from Euclid's First Proposition:</p> <blockquote> <p>(A)  Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other.<br>(B)  The two sides of this Triangle are things that are equal to the same.<br>(Z)  The two sides of this Triangle are equal to each other.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tortoise:  "And if some reader had <em>not</em> yet accepted A and B as true, he might still accept the <em>sequence</em> as a <em>valid</em> one, I suppose?"</p> <p>Achilles:   "No doubt such a reader might exist.  He might say, 'I accept as true the Hypothetical Proposition that, <em>if</em> A and B be true, Z must be true; but, I <em>don't</em> accept A and B as true.'  Such a reader would do wisely in abandoning Euclid, and taking to football."</p> <p>Tortoise:  "And might there not <em>also</em> be some reader who would say, 'I accept A and B as true, but I <em>don't</em> accept the Hypothetical'?"</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>Achilles, unwisely, concedes this; and so asks the Tortoise to accept another proposition:</p> <blockquote> <p>(C)  If A and B are true, Z must be true.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, asks, the Tortoise, suppose that he accepts A and B and C, but not Z?</p> <p>Then, says, Achilles, he must ask the Tortoise to accept one more hypothetical:</p> <blockquote> <p>(D)  If A and B and C are true, Z must be true.</p> </blockquote> <p>Douglas Hofstadter paraphrased the argument some time later:</p> <blockquote> <p>Achilles:  If you have [(A&#8743;B)&#8594;Z], and you also have (A&#8743;B), then surely you have Z.<br>Tortoise:  Oh!  You mean &lt;{(A&#8743;B)&#8743;[(A&#8743;B)&#8594;Z]}&#8594;Z&gt;, don't you?</p> </blockquote> <p>As Hofstadter says, "Whatever Achilles considers a rule of inference, the Tortoise immediately flattens into a mere string of the system.  If you use only the letters A, B, and Z, you will get a recursive pattern of longer and longer strings."</p> <p>By now you should recognize the anti-pattern <a href="0387.html">Passing the Recursive Buck</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rd/passing_the_recursive_buck/]; and though the counterspell is sometimes hard to find, when found, it generally takes the form <a href="0384.html">The Buck Stops Immediately</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ra/causality_and_moral_responsibility/].</p> <p>The Tortoise's mind needs the <em>dynamic</em> of adding Y to the belief pool when X and (X&#8594;Y) are previously in the belief pool.  If this dynamic is not present&#8212;a rock, for example, lacks it&#8212;then you can go on adding in X and (X&#8594;Y) and (X&#8743;(X&#8594;Y))&#8594;Y until the end of eternity, without ever getting to Y.</p> <p>The phrase that once came into my mind to describe this requirement, is that a mind must be <em>created already in motion.</em>  There is no argument so compelling that it will give dynamics to a static thing.  There is no computer program so <em>persuasive</em> that you can run it on a rock.</p> <p>And even if you have a mind that <em>does</em> carry out modus ponens, it is futile for it to have such beliefs as...</p> <blockquote> <p>(A)  If a toddler is on the train tracks, then pulling them off is fuzzle.<br>(B)  There is a toddler on the train tracks.</p> </blockquote> <p>...unless the mind also <em>implements:</em></p> <blockquote> <p><em>Dynamic:</em>  When the belief pool contains "X is fuzzle", send X to the action system.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<strong>Added:</strong>  Apparently this wasn't clear...  By "dynamic" I mean a property of a physically implemented cognitive system's <em>development over time</em>.  A "dynamic" is something that <em>happens inside</em> a cognitive system, <em>not</em> data that it stores in memory and manipulates.  Dynamics are the manipulations.  There is no way to write a dynamic on a piece of paper, because the paper will just lie there.  So the text immediately above, which says "dynamic", is not dynamic.  If I wanted the text to <em>be</em> dynamic and not just <em>say</em> "dynamic", I would have to write a Java applet.)</p> <p>Needless to say, having the belief...</p> <blockquote> <p>(C)  If the belief pool contains "X is fuzzle", then "send 'X' to the action system" is fuzzle.</p> </blockquote> <p>...won't help unless the mind already implements the <em>behavior</em> of translating hypothetical actions labeled 'fuzzle' into actual motor actions.</p> <p>By dint of careful arguments about the nature of cognitive systems, you might be able to prove...</p> <blockquote> <p>(D)   A mind with a dynamic that sends plans labeled "fuzzle" to the action system, is more fuzzle than minds that don't.</p> </blockquote> <p>...but that <em>still</em> won't help, unless the listening mind <em>previously</em> possessed the <em>dynamic</em> of swapping out its current source code for alternative source code that is believed to be more fuzzle.</p> <p>This is why you can't argue fuzzleness into a rock.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence"><em>The Metaethics Sequence</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0404.html">The Bedrock of Fairness</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ru/the_bedrock_of_fairness/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rr/the_moral_void/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq14.html">Sequence 14: Metaethics</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0404.html">The Bedrock of Fairness</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0401.html">The Moral Void</a> &#8226; <a href="0404.html">The Bedrock of Fairness</a> &#8226; <a href="0410.html">Where Recursive Justification Hits Bottom</a> &#8226; <a href="0414.html">Fundamental Doubts</a> &#8226; <a href="0425.html">Fake Norms, or "Truth" vs. Truth</a> &#8226; <a href="0430.html">Changing Your Metaethics</a> &#8226; <a href="0432.html">The Meaning of Right</a> &#8226; <a href="0442.html">Morality as Fixed Computation</a> &#8226; <a href="0443.html">Inseparably Right; or, Joy in the Merely Good</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/rs/created_already_in_motion/">Created Already In Motion</a></p></body></html>
