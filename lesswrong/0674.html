But religion also serves the function of an asphyxiated canary in a coal mine&#8212;religion is a sign, a symptom, of larger problems that don't go away just because someone loses their religion.</p> <p>Consider this thought experiment&#8212;what could you teach people that is not <em>directly</em> about religion, which is true and useful as a <em>general </em>method of rationality, which would cause them to lose their religions?  In fact&#8212;imagine that we're going to go and survey all your students five years later, and see how many of them have lost their religions compared to a control group; if you make the slightest move at fighting religion <em>directly,</em> you will invalidate the experiment.  You may not make a single mention of religion or any religious belief in your classroom, you may not even hint at it in any obvious way.  All your examples must center about real-world cases that have nothing to do with religion.</p> <p>If you can't fight religion <em>directly,</em> what do you teach that raises the <em>general waterline of sanity</em> to the point that religion goes underwater?<a id="more"></a></p> <p>Here are some such topics I've already covered&#8212;<em>not</em> avoiding all mention of religion, but it could be done:</p> <ul> <li><a href="0180.html">Affective Death Spirals</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/lm/affective_death_spirals/]&#8212;plenty of <a href="0195.html">non-supernaturalist</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/m1/guardians_of_ayn_rand/] examples.</li> <li>How to avoid <a href="0127.html">cached thoughts</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/k5/cached_thoughts/] and <a href="0130.html">fake wisdom</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/k8/how_to_seem_and_be_deep/];

A quick introduction to <em>all</em> of them (well, except <a href="0629.html">naturalistic metaethics</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/y3/value_is_fragile/]) would be... a four-credit undergraduate course with no prerequisites?</p> <p>But there are Nobel laureates who haven't taken that course!  <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/02/what_evidence_i.html?cid=61577404#comment-61577404">Richard Smalley</a> [http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/02/what_evidence_i.html?cid=61577404#comment-61577404] if you're looking for a cheap shot, or <a href="0354.html">Robert Aumann</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/qg/changing_the_definition_of_science/] if you're looking for a scary shot.</p> <p>And they can't be isolated exceptions.  If all of their professional compatriots had taken that course, then Smalley or Aumann would either have been corrected (as their colleagues kindly took them aside and explained the bare fundamentals) or else regarded with too much pity and concern to win a Nobel Prize.  Could you&#8212;<em>realistically </em>speaking, regardless of fairness&#8212;win a Nobel while advocating the existence of Santa Claus?</p> <p>That's what the dead canary, religion, is telling us: that the general sanity waterline is currently <em>really ridiculously low.</em>  Even in the highest halls of science.</p> <p>If we throw out that dead and rotting canary, then our mine may stink a bit less, but the sanity waterline may not rise much higher.</p> <p>This is not to criticize the neo-atheist movement.  The harm done by religion is clear and present danger, or rather, current and ongoing disaster.  Fighting religion's directly harmful effects takes precedence over its use as a canary or experimental indicator.  But even if Dawkins, and Dennett, and Harris, and Hitchens should somehow win utterly and absolutely to the last corner of the human sphere, the real work of rationalists will be only just beginning.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="0726.html"><em>The Craft and the Community</em></a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/cz/the_craft_and_the_community/]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0675.html">A Sense That More Is Possible</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/2c/a_sense_that_more_is_possible/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">(start of sequence)</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq16.html">Sequence 16: The Craft and the Community</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="seq15.html">Sequence 15: Fun Theory</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0675.html">A Sense That More Is Possible</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0675.html">A Sense That More Is Possible</a> &#8226; <a href="0692.html">Rationality: Common Interest of Many Causes</a> &#8226; <a href="0726.html">The Craft and the Community</a> &#8226; <a href="0734.html">This Failing Earth</a> &#8226; <a href="0766.html">I'm Not Saying People Are Stupid</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/">Raising the Sanity Waterline</a></p></body></html>
