(Yes, she's a solid atheist in no danger whatsoever, thank you for asking.)</p> <p>And as she said this, it reminded me of how wrong it is to give gratitude to God for blessings that actually come from our fellow human beings putting in a great deal of work.</p> <p>So I at once put my hands together and said,</p> <p>"Dear Global Economy, we thank thee for thy economies of scale, thy professional specialization, and thy international networks of trade under Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage, without which we would all starve to death while trying to assemble the ingredients for such a dinner as this.  Amen."</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/wa/thanksgiving_prayer/">Thanksgiving Prayer</a></p></body></html>
