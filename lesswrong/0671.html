I helplessly want to say.</p> <p><a href="0670.html">Or</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/#u3]:</p> <blockquote> <p>I chose to believe in the existence of God&#8212;deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you <em>know </em>your belief isn't correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?</p> <p>Shouldn't the <em>gut-level</em> realization, "Oh, wait, the sky really <em>isn't</em> green" follow from the realization "My map that says 'the sky is green' has no reason to be correlated with the territory"?</p> <p>Well... apparently not.</p> <p>One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of <a href="0670.html">Moore's Paradox</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/] ("It's raining, but I don't believe it is")&#8212;that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.</p> <p>But another part of it may just be that&#8212;contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward&#8212;it's actually quite <em>easy</em> not to make the jump from "The map that reflects the territory would say 'X'" to actually believing "X".  It takes some work to <em>explain</em> the ideas of <a href="0107.html">minds as map-territory correspondence builders</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/jl/what_is_evidence/], and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a <em>gut level</em>.<a id="more"></a></p> <p>I realize now that when I <a href="0670.html">wrote</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/] "You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will", I wasn't just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts.  I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating "I can't get away with double-thinking!  Deep down, I'll know it's not true!  If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don't believe it!"</p> <p>Because that way&#8212;if you're ever tempted to try&#8212;the thoughts "But I know this isn't really true!" and "I can't fool myself!" will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully.  You're more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself X doesn't make X true: and therefore, really truly not-X.</p> <p>If you keep telling yourself that you <em>can't</em> just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green&#8212;then you're less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into <a href="0670.html">Moore's Paradox</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1f/moores_paradox/], <a href="0054.html">belief in belief</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/], or <a href="0667.html">belief in self-deception</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/].</p> <p>If you keep telling yourself that deep down you'll know&#8212;</p> <p>If you keep telling yourself that you'd just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn't be able to invest any credulity in it&#8212;</p> <p>If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting&#8212;</p> <p>Then when push comes to shove&#8212;you may, indeed, fail.</p> <p>When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must <em>believe in your own inability!</em></p> <p>Tell yourself the effort is doomed&#8212;<em>and it will be!</em></p> <p>Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking?
