Their very construction seems to defy the nature of thaumaturgical law.  In fact, they are impossible.  Like most products of gnomish minds, they include a large number of bells and whistles, and very little substance.  Those that work usually have a <em>minor helm</em> contained within, always hidden away, disguised to appear innocuous and inessential."<br>  &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; -- Spelljammer campaign set</p></blockquote> <p>We have seen that knowledge implies <a href="0268.html">mutual information</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/] between a mind and its environment, and we have seen that this <a href="0271.html">mutual information is negentropy</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/] in a very physical sense:  If you know where molecules are and how fast they're moving, you can turn heat into work via a Maxwell's Demon / Szilard engine.</p> <p>We have seen that <a href="0272.html">forming true beliefs without evidence</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o6/perpetual_motion_beliefs/] is the same sort of improbability as a hot glass of water spontaneously reorganizing into ice cubes and electricity.  Rationality takes "work" in a thermodynamic sense, not just the sense of mental effort; minds have to radiate heat if they are not perfectly efficient.  This cognitive work is governed by probability theory, of which thermodynamics is a special case.  (Statistical mechanics is a special case of statistics.)</p> <p>If you saw a machine continually spinning a wheel, apparently without being plugged into a wall outlet or any other source of power, then you would look for a hidden battery, or a nearby broadcast power source - something to explain the work being done, without violating the laws of physics.</p> <p>So if a mind is arriving at true beliefs, and we assume that the <a href="0271.html">second law of thermodynamics</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o5/the_second_law_of_thermodynamics_and_engines_of/] has not been violated, that mind must be doing something at least <em>vaguely</em> Bayesian - at least one process with a sort-of Bayesian structure <em>somewhere</em> - or it <em>couldn't possibly work</em>.</p> <a id="more"></a><p>In the beginning, at time T=0, a mind has no mutual information with a subsystem S in its environment.  At time T=1,the mind has 10 bits of mutual information with S.  Somewhere in between, the mind must have encountered evidence - under the Bayesian definition of evidence, because all Bayesian evidence is mutual information and all mutual information is Bayesian evidence, they are just different ways of looking at it - and processed at least some of that evidence, however inefficiently, in the right direction according to Bayes on at least some occasions.  The mind must have <em>moved in harmony with the Bayes</em> at least a little, somewhere along the line - either that or violated the second law of thermodynamics by creating mutual information from nothingness.</p> <p>In fact, any <em>part</em> of a cognitive process that <em>contributes usefully</em> to truth-finding must have at least a little Bayesian structure - must harmonize with Bayes, at some point or another - must partially conform with the Bayesian flow, however noisily - despite however many disguising bells and whistles - even if this Bayesian structure is only apparent in the context of surrounding processes.  Or it couldn't even <em>help.</em></p> <p>How philosophers pondered the nature of words!  All the ink spent on the <a href="0256.html">true definitions of words</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nq/feel_the_meaning/], and the <a href="0254.html">true meaning of definitions</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/no/how_an_algorithm_feels_from_inside/], and the <a href="0253.html">true meaning of meaning</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nn/neural_categories/]!  What collections of gears and wheels they built, in their explanations!  And all along, it was a <a href="0252.html">disguised</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/nm/disguised_queries/] form of <a href="0268.html">Bayesian</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/] <a href="0246.html">inference</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ng/words_as_hidden_inferences/]!</p> <p>I was actually a bit disappointed that no one in the audience jumped up and said:  "<em>Yes!  Yes, that's it!  Of course!  It was really Bayes all along!</em>"</p> <p>But perhaps it is not <em>quite</em> as exciting to see something that <em>doesn't</em> look Bayesian on the surface, revealed as Bayes wearing a clever disguise, if: (a) you don't unravel the mystery yourself, but read about someone else doing it (Newton had more fun than most students taking calculus), and (b) you don't realize that <em>searching for the hidden Bayes-structure</em> is this huge, difficult, omnipresent quest, like searching for the Holy Grail.</p> <p>It's a different quest for each facet of cognition, but the Grail always <em>turns out</em> to be the same.  It has to be the <em>right</em> Grail, though - and the <em>entire</em> Grail, without any parts missing - and so each time you have to go on the quest looking for a full answer <em>whatever</em> form it may take, rather than trying to artificially construct vaguely hand-waving Grailish arguments.  <em>Then</em> you always find the same Holy Grail at the end.</p> <p>It was previously pointed out to me that I might be losing some of my readers with the long essays, because I hadn't "made it clear where I was going"...</p> <p>...but it's <a href="0138.html">not so easy</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/] to just tell people where you're going, when you're going somewhere like <em>that.</em></p> <p>It's not very helpful to merely <em>know that</em> a form of cognition is Bayesian, if you don't <em>know how</em> it is Bayesian.  If you can't see the detailed flow of probability, you have nothing but a <a href="0076.html">password</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/] - or, a bit more charitably, a hint at the form an answer would take; but certainly not an answer.  That's why there's a Grand Quest for the Hidden Bayes-Structure, rather than being done when you say "Bayes!" Bayes-structure can be buried under all kinds of disguies, hidden behind thickets of wheels and gears, obscured by bells and whistles.</p> <p>The way you begin to grasp the Quest for the Holy Bayes is that you learn about cognitive phenomenon XYZ, which seems really useful - and there's this bunch of philosophers who've been arguing about its true nature for centuries, and they are still arguing - and there's a bunch of AI scientists trying to make a computer do it, but they can't agree on the philosophy either -</p> <p>And - <em>Huh, that's odd!</em> - this cognitive phenomenon didn't look anything like Bayesian on the surface, but there's this non-obvious underlying structure that has a Bayesian interpretation - but wait, there's still some useful work getting done that can't be explained in Bayesian terms - no wait, <em>that's</em> Bayesian too - OH MY GOD this <em>completely different</em> cognitive process, that <em>also</em> didn't look Bayesian on the surface, ALSO HAS BAYESIAN STRUCTURE - hold on, are these non-Bayesian parts even <em>doing</em> anything?</p> <ul><li>Yes:  Wow, those are Bayesian too!</li> <li>No:  Dear heavens, what a <a href="0151.html">stupid design</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/kt/evolutions_are_stupid_but_work_anyway/].  I could eat a bucket of amino acids and puke a better brain architecture than that.</li></ul> <p>Once this happens to you a few times, you kinda pick up the rhythm.  That's what I'm talking about here, the rhythm.</p> <p>Trying to talk about the rhythm is like trying to dance about architecture.</p> <p>This left me in a bit of a pickle when it came to trying to explain in advance where I was going.  I know from experience that if I say, "Bayes is the secret of the universe," some people may say "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T1LIrzsgqA">Yes!</a> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2T1LIrzsgqA]  Bayes is the secret of the universe!"; and others will snort and say, "<a href="0223.html">How narrow-minded you are</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/]; look at all these other ad-hoc but amazingly useful methods, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization#Bayesian_interpretation">regularized linear regression</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization#Bayesian_interpretation], that <a href="0223.html">I have in my toolbox</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/]."</p> <p>I hoped that with a specific example in hand of "something that doesn't look all that Bayesian on the surface, but <a href="0268.html">turns out to be Bayesian after all</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/o2/mutual_information_and_density_in_thingspace/]" - <em>and</em> an explanation of <a href="0076.html">the difference between passwords and knowledge</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/iq/guessing_the_teachers_password/] - <em>and</em> an explanation of <a href="0223.html">the difference between tools and laws</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/mt/beautiful_probability/] - maybe <em>then</em> I could convey such of the rhythm as can be understood without personally going on the quest.</p> <p>Of course this is not the <em>full</em> Secret of the Bayesian Conspiracy, but it's all that I can convey at this point.  Besides, the complete secret is known only to the Bayes Council, and if I told you, I'd have to hire you.</p> <p>To <em>see through</em> the surface adhockery of a cognitive process, to the Bayesian structure <em>underneath</em> - to perceive the probability flows, and <em>know how,</em> not just <em>know that,</em> this cognition too is Bayesian - as it always is - as it always must be - to be able to sense the Force underlying all cognition - this, is the Bayes-Sight.</p><blockquote><p>    "...And the Queen of Kashfa sees with the Eye of the Serpent."<br>
