Slowly, as if under a heavy burden, she turns around to face Joseph.)</em></p> <p>Joseph:  You seem to be getting fat around the waistline, and throwing up in the morning, and, er, not getting any periods.  Which is odd, because it's sort of like -</p> <p>Mary:  Yes!  I'm pregnant!  All right?  I'm PREGNANT!</p> <p>Joseph:  How is that possible?</p> <p><em>(Mary's shoulders slump further.)</em>  Mary:  How do you think?</p> <p>Joseph:  I don't know, that's why I'm asking you.  I mean, you're still a virgin, right?</p> <p><em>(Mary looks up cautiously, and sees Joseph's face looking blankly puzzled.)</em></p> <p>Joseph:  Well?</p> <p>Mary:  God did it.</p> <p>Joseph:  You had <em>sex</em> with -</p> <p>Mary:  No!  Haha.  Of course not.  I mean, God just snapped his fingers and did one of those miracle things and made me pregnant.</p> <p>Joseph:  <em>God</em> made you pregnant.</p> <p>Mary:  <em>(Starts to sweat.)</em>  Yes.</p> <p>Joseph:  Mary, that is just so... <em>completely...</em></p> <p><em>(Mary's eyes squeeze shut.)</em></p> <p>Joseph:  ...COOL!</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p><em>(Mary opens her eyes again, cautiously.)</em></p> <p>Mary:  You think so?</p> <p>Joseph:  Of course!  Who <em>wouldn't</em> think so?  Come on, we've got to tell <em>everyone</em> the news!</p> <p>Mary:  Maybe we should keep this between just the two of us -</p> <p>Joseph:  No, no, silly girl, this is way too important!  Come on!</p> <p><em>(Joseph grabs Mary's wrist and drags her out of the house. SCENE:  The gathering square of Nazareth.  A dozen well-dressed men, and the town's head rabbi, look on Joseph and Mary impatiently.)</em></p> <p>Rabbi:  What's this all about, Joseph?  I trust there's a good reason for the fuss?</p> <p>Joseph:  Go ahead, Mary!  Tell them what you told me.</p> <p>Mary:  Um...  <em>(She swallows.)</em>  God made me pregnant.</p> <p>Rabbi, looking stern, yet understanding:  Now, Joseph, you know you're not supposed to do that before -</p> <p>Joseph:  No, no, you don't get it!  She's still a virgin!  God made her pregnant <em>directly!</em></p> <p><em>(There's a long pause.)</em></p> <p>Man #1:  So, what you're saying here, basically, is that Mary tells you she's a virgin.</p> <p>Joseph:  Uh huh!</p> <p>Man #2:  And you haven't had sex with her.</p> <p>Joseph:  Uh huh!</p> <p>Man #3:  And now she's pregnant.</p> <p>Joseph:  Precisely!</p> <p>Man #4:  So you think that God did it.</p> <p>Joseph:  What other explanation could there be?</p> <p>Rabbi:  Joseph, that is just so... unbelievably...</p> <p><em>(Mary holds her breath.)</em></p> <p>Rabbi:  NEAT!</p> <p><em>(Mary exhales.)</em></p> <p>Man #5:  A miracle!  A miracle right here in Nazareth!</p> <p>Man #6:  Wow!  I thought that miracles only happened in Jerusalem!</p> <p>Man #7:  Come on!  Let's spread the good news!</p> <p><em>(They depart.  SCENE:  Mary is alone with her friend, Betty, in Betty's house.)</em></p> <p>Betty:  "God did it."</p> <p>Mary:  I panicked!  It was all I could think of!</p> <p>Betty:  So who's the real -</p> <p><em>(Mary lifts an eyebrow significantly.  There's a brief pause.)</em></p> <p>Betty:  Ah.  So that's why the rabbi went along with it.</p> <p>Mary:  Well, he <em>thinks</em> he's the father, anyway.  Why, does it matter?</p> <p>Betty:  It puts some things in a different light.</p> <p>Mary:  Like what?<em> </em></p> <p>Betty:  The rabbi has been telling all the pretty young girls that you, Mary, are the ultimate embodiment of feminine virtue, and when they grow up, they should be <em>just like you</em> -</p> <p>Mary:  I just feel so awful about the whole mess.  What kind of thing is this to have hanging over my child's life?</p> <p>Betty:  You've got to put things in perspective, dearie.  You told one little white lie.  It's not as if you caused the fall of the Roman Empire.</p> <p>Mary:  But what if the Romans hear about it?  I don't want my baby to end up being crucified!</p> <p>Betty:  No one's going to obsess about it that long.  In a couple of months this whole thing will blow over.</p> <p>Mary:  I hope you're right...</p> <p><em>(Exeunt Omnes.)</em></p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0514.html">Entangled Truths, Contagious Lies</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/m8/the_amazing_virgin_pregnancy/">The Amazing Virgin Pregnancy</a></p></body></html>
