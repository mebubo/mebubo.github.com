The explanation for someone's current will <a href="0386.html">cannot be their current will</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rc/the_ultimate_source/] - though it can include their past will.</p> <p>On the second interpretation, the sentence says that alternate choices are not <a href="0385.html">reachable</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/rb/possibility_and_couldness/] - that we couldn't have taken other options even "if we had wanted to do so".</p> <p>On the third interpretation, the sentence says that we cannot control our own desires - that we are the prisoners of our own passions, even when we struggle against them.</p> <p>On the fourth interpretation, the sentence says that we cannot control our own desires, because our desires themselves will determine which desires we want, and so protect themselves.</p> <p>I count two true interpretations and two false interpretations.  How about you?</p> </div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/rz/will_as_thou_wilt/">Will As Thou Wilt</a></p></body></html>
