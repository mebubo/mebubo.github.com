Hillary is down 7.5 percentage points in just the last day.  (Note:  Between when I wrote the above, and when I posted this, Hillary went up to 54.)</p> <p>From what I've read on Intrade, you can fund your account with up to $250 using a credit card, and it should land in your account immediately.  (More than this takes time.)  Also, remember that you can sell contracts at any time afterward - you don't have to wait months to collect your payout.</p> <p>If you think that Hillary is going to do better than the polls on Super Tuesday, and you're going to sneer afterward and say that Intrade was "just tracking the polls", <strong>buy Hillary now.</strong></p> <p>If you think that Obama is going to do better than the polls on Super Tuesday, and you're going to gloat about how prediction markets didn't call this surprise in advance, <strong>buy Obama now.</strong></p> <p>If you don't do either, then clearly you do not <em>really</em> believe that you know anything the prediction markets don't.  (Or you don't understand <a href="0229.html">expected utility</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/mz/zut_allais/], or your utilities over final outcomes drop off improbably fast in the vicinity of your current wealth minus fifty bucks - you don't have to bet the full $250.)  It is <strong>free money, going now</strong> for anyone who genuinely thinks they know better than the prediction markets what will happen next.</p> <p>Prediction markets do not have supernatural insight.  If they give the candidates fifty-fifty odds, it means that the market collectively <em>doesn't know</em> what will happen next.  Even if you're well-calibrated, you get surprised on 90% probabilities one time out of ten.</p> <p><strong>The point is not that prediction markets are a <em>good</em> predictor but that they are the <em>best</em> predictor.</strong>  If you think you can do better, why ain'cha rich?  Any person, group, or method that does better can pump money out of the prediction markets.</p> <p>If prediction markets react to polls, they're <em>getting new information</em>, that they didn't predict in advance, <em>which happens.</em>  Being the best predictor doesn't make you omniscient.</p> <p>Everyone's going to find it real easy to <a href="0071.html">make a better prediction <em>afterward</em></a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/il/hindsight_bias/], but <strong>if you think you can call it <em>in advance</em>, there's FREE MONEY GOING NOW.</strong></p> <p>Buy now, or forever hold your peace.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0353.html">No Safe Defense, Not Even Science</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ni/buy_now_or_forever_hold_your_peace/">Buy Now Or Forever Hold Your Peace</a></p></body></html>
