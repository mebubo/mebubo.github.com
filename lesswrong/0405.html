Sorry if anyone has gotten this impression.</p> <p>However, among the 10 "Recent Comments" visible in the sidebar at right, usually no more than 2, rarely 3, and never 4, should be yours.  This is meant to ensure no one person dominates a thread; it gives others a chance to respond to others' responses.  One-line comments that quickly correct an error may be common-sensically excepted from this rule.</p> <p>You need not <em>refrain</em> from commenting, just wait a bit.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/rv/2_of_10_not_3_total/">2 of 10, not 3 total</a></p></body></html>
