Friedman asks</a> [http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2008/09/prediction-vs-explanation-puzzle.html]:</p><blockquote><p>We do ten experiments. A scientist observes the results, constructs a theory consistent with them, and uses it to predict the results of the next ten. We do them and the results fit his predictions. A second scientist now constructs a theory consistent with the results of all twenty experiments.</p> <p>The two theories give different predictions for the next experiment. Which do we believe? Why?</p></blockquote><p>One of the commenters links to <em>Overcoming Bias</em>, but as of 11PM on Sep 28th, David's blog's time, no one has given the exact answer that I would have given.  It's interesting that a question so basic has received so many answers.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ud/friedmans_prediction_vs_explanation/">Friedman's "Prediction vs. Explanation"</a></p></body></html>
