Maybe I am simply mistaken about the nature of changes in morality that have previously occurred&#8212;like looking at a time chart of "differences between past and present", noting that the difference has been steadily decreasing, and saying, without being able to visualize it, "Extrapolating this chart into the future, we find that the future will be even less different from the present than the present."</p> <p>So let me throw the question open to my readers:  Whither moral progress?</p> <p>You might say, perhaps, "Over time, people have become more willing to help one another&#8212;that is the very substance and definition of moral progress."</p> <p>But as John McCarthy put it:</p> <blockquote> <p>"If everyone were to live for others all the time, life would be like a procession of ants following each other around in a circle."</p> </blockquote> <p>Once you make "People helping each other more" the <em>definition</em> of moral progress, then people helping each other all the time, is <em>by definition</em> the <em>apex</em> of moral progress.</p> <p>At the very least we have Moore's Open Question:  It is not clear that helping others all the time is <em>automatically</em> moral progress, whether or not you argue that it is; and so we apparently have some notion of what constitutes "moral progress" that goes beyond the direct identification with "helping others more often".</p> <p>Or if you identify moral progress with "<a href="0097.html">Democracy!</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/]", then at some point there was a first democratic civilization&#8212;at some point, people went from having no notion of democracy as a good thing, to inventing the idea of democracy as a good thing.  If increasing democracy is the very substance of moral progress, then how did this moral progress come about to exist in the world?  How did people invent, without knowing it, this very substance of moral progress?</p> <p>It's easy to come up with <em>concrete</em> examples of moral progress.  Just point to a moral disagreement between past and present civilizations; or point to a disagreement between yourself and present civilization, and claim that future civilizations might agree with you.</p> <p>It's harder to answer Subhan's challenge&#8212;to show <em>directionality,</em> rather than a random walk, on the meta-level.  And explain how this directionality is implemented, on the meta-level: how people go from not having a moral ideal, to having it.</p> <p>(I have my own ideas about this, as some of you know.
