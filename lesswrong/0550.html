As for myself - I'm not finished, but I'm way over schedule and need to move on soon.  I'm not going to stop posting entirely (I doubt I could if I tried) but I'm not going to be posting daily.</p> <p>There are three directions that Overcoming Bias could go from here:</p> <p>First, we could find enough <em>good</em> authors to keep going at a post per day.  Say, seven people who can and will write one post per week.  We can't compromise on quality, though.</p> <p>Second, we could try to shift to a more community-based format.  Our most popular post <em>ever</em>, still getting hits to this day, was not written by Robin or myself or any of the recurring editors.  It's "<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/my-favorite-lia.html">My Favorite Liar</a> [http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/02/my-favorite-lia.html]" by Kai Chang, about the professor who inserted one false statement into each lecture.  If one-tenth of our readers contributed a single story as good as this... but neither Robin nor myself have time to vet them all.  So one approach would be to have a community forum where anyone could post, readers voted the posts up and down, and a front page to which the editors promoted posts deemed worthy.  I understand that Scoop has software like this, but I would like to know <strong>if our readers can recommend better community software</strong> (see below).</p> <p>Third, we could close OB to new submissions and keep the archives online eternally, saying, "It had a good run."  As Nick put it, we shouldn't keep going if it means a slow degeneration.</p><a id="more"></a><p>My own perspective:  <em>Overcoming Bias</em> presently gets over a quarter-million monthly pageviews.  We've built something that seems like it should be important.  It feels premature, but I would like to try to launch an online rationalist community.</p> <p>At this point, I'm advocating a hybrid approach:  Keep OB open with fewer posts of the same <em>gravitas,</em> hang out a sign for new authors, and also try starting up a community-based site with user submissions and more frequent shorter posts.  I've got plenty of light stuff to post, links and the like.</p> <p>But:  <strong>What software should we use to support a rationalist community?</strong></p> <p>The Oxford Future of Humanity Institute and the Singularity Institute have volunteered to provide funding if necessary, so we aren't limited to free software.</p> <p>And obviously we're not looking for software that lets our users throw sheep at one another.  The Internet already offers enough ways to waste time, thank you.  More like - how people can find each other geographically and meet up; something Reddit-like for upvoting and downvoting posts, links, and comments; better comment threading; ways to see only new comments on posts you've flagged - that sort of thing.  You know, actually useful stuff.  A lot of Web 2.0 seems to be designed for people with lots of time to waste, but I don't think we can assume that fact about our readership.</p> <p>Even if you don't know the name of the software, if there's a community site you visit that does an exceptional job - letting users upvote and downvote to keep the quality high, threading discussions while still giving busy people a fast way to see what new comments have been posted, making it easy for both newcomers and oldtimers - go ahead and say what we should be looking at.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0627.html">OB Status Update</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/vw/whither_ob/">Whither OB?</a></p></body></html>
