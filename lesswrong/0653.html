Such people can get up to speed on particular subjects quite rapidly.  Sometimes their lack of a broad education makes them over-apt to go off on intellectual wild goose chases, but, hey, at least a wild goose chase gives you some exercise."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160; -- Neal Stephenson, <a href="http://steve-parker.org/articles/others/stephenson/interface.shtml">In the Beginning was the Command Line</a> [http://steve-parker.org/articles/others/stephenson/interface.shtml]</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/yr/rationality_quotes_27/">Rationality Quotes 27</a></p></body></html>
