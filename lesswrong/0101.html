Like writer's block, only instead of <em>not</em> writing, I write very <em>slooowly.</em> At least when it comes to writing Documents - papers, book chapters, website material.  If I haven't published a hundred papers, it's not for lack of a hundred ideas, but because writing one paper - at my current pace - takes four months full time.  I sometimes wonder if I could become a respectable academic if I wrote at a respectable pace.</p> <p>Oddly enough, I can write most emails around as fast as I type. Such disorders are hard to self-diagnose, but I suspect that part of the problem is that on Documents I repeatedly reread and tweak material I've already written, instead of writing new material.  James Hogan (an SF author) once told me that he was more productive on a typewriter than a word processor, because the typewriter prevented him from tweaking until the second draft.</p> <p>A blook is a collection of blog posts that have been edited into a book.  Logically, then, publishing a book as a series of blog posts ought to be known as "blooking".</p><a id="more"></a><p>It would be more precise to say that I'm generating raw material to be edited into a book, and collecting some feedback along the way. I make no promises for this project.  (I hate promising anything unless I have already done it.)  The first part of the plan, generating the raw material as blog posts, has proceeded at a respectable pace so far.  Will I be able to edit the posts into chapters, so long as all the raw material is there?  Will I be able to generate all the raw material, or will the project, ahem, "blog down"?</p> <p>In August I decided that I was going to write one blog post <em>per day</em> for Overcoming Bias.  This challenge began to hone my writing speed somewhat - for example, I would look at the clock and try not to take longer than an hour... or three hours... but nonetheless I began to feel the need to <em>shove the post out the door</em> instead of perfecting it further.  This is necessary and proper.</p> <p>Near the end of August, I faced a new challenge - I also had to prepare two talks for the Singularity Summit 2007 (Sep 8-9).  Those were actual Documents.  I knew, from previous experience, that I couldn't possibly prepare the two talks and also keep up the pace of blogging on Overcoming Bias.  Blogging was using up all my writing energy already - I have only a limited supply of words per day.  If I overreach one day's budget I can't write at all the next day.  So (I knew) I would have to temporarily stop blogging and resume after the Summit.</p> <p>And then I said to myself, <em>Hey, if I never try to do anything "impossible", I'll never grow.</em></p> <p>I decided I would keep up the pace on Overcoming Bias while <em>simultaneously</em> writing my two Summit talks.  <a href="0022.html">Tsuyoku naritai!</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/]</p> <p>I lost sleep, and skipped exercise.  But I did it.  I'll remember that the next time I'm thinking of trying something impossible.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0242.html">Newcomb's Problem and Regret of Rationality</a> &#8226; <a href="0287.html">Penguicon &amp; Blook</a> &#8226; <a href="0372.html">Why Quantum?</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jf/why_im_blooking/">Why I'm Blooking</a></p></body></html>
