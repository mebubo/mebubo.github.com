Many failures occurred in sequence, but one mistake stands out as most critical:  My younger self did not realize that <em>solving a mystery should make it feel less confusing.</em>  I was trying to explain a Mysterious Phenomenon&#8212;which to me meant providing a cause for it, fitting it into an integrated model of reality.  Why should this make the phenomenon less Mysterious, when that is its nature?  I was trying to <em>explain</em> the Mysterious Phenomenon, not render it (by some impossible alchemy) into a mundane phenomenon, a phenomenon that wouldn't even call out for an unusual explanation in the first place.<br><br>As a Traditional Rationalist, I knew the historical tales of astrologers and astronomy, of alchemists and chemistry, of vitalists and biology.  But the Mysterious Phenomenon was not like this.  It was something <em>new, </em>something stranger, something more difficult, something that ordinary science had failed to explain for centuries&#8212;</p> <p>- as if stars and matter and life had not been mysteries for hundreds of years and thousands of years, from the dawn of human thought right up until science finally solved them&#8212;</p> <p>We learn about astronomy and chemistry and biology in school, and it seems to us that these matters have <em>always been</em> the proper realm of science, that they have <em>never been</em> mysterious.  When science dares to challenge a new Great Puzzle, the children of that generation are skeptical, for they have never seen science explain something that <em>feels</em> mysterious to them.  Science is only good for explaining <em>scientific</em> subjects, like stars and matter and life.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>I thought the lesson of history was that astrologers and alchemists and vitalists had an <a href="0049.html">innate character flaw</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/hz/correspondence_bias/], a tendency toward mysterianism, which led them to come up with mysterious explanations for non-mysterious subjects.  But surely, if a phenomenon really <em>was</em> very weird, a weird explanation might be in order?</p> <p>It was only afterward, when I began to see the mundane structure inside the mystery, that I realized whose shoes I was standing in.  Only then did I realize how reasonable vitalism had seemed<em> at the time</em>, how <em>surprising</em> and <em>embarrassing</em> had been the universe's reply of, "Life is mundane, and does not need a weird explanation."</p> <p>We read history but we don't <em>live</em> it, we don't <em>experience</em> it.  If only I had <em>personally</em> postulated astrological mysteries and then discovered Newtonian mechanics, postulated alchemical mysteries and then discovered chemistry, postulated vitalistic mysteries and then discovered biology.  I would have thought of my Mysterious Answer and said to myself:  <em>No way am I falling for that again.</em></p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions"><em>Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j0/making_history_available/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0084.html">My Wild and Reckless Youth</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/iy/my_wild_and_reckless_youth/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq02.html">Sequence 02: Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0084.html">My Wild and Reckless Youth</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0084.html">My Wild and Reckless Youth</a> &#8226; <a href="0086.html">Making History Available</a> &#8226; <a href="0092.html">Why is the Future So Absurd?</a> &#8226; <a href="0167.html">Artificial Addition</a> &#8226; <a href="0221.html">Expecting Beauty</a> &#8226; <a href="0305.html">Angry Atoms</a> &#8226; <a href="0306.html">Heat vs. Motion</a> &#8226; <a href="0589.html">Living By Your Own Strength</a> &#8226; <a href="0611.html">Eutopia is Scary</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/iz/failing_to_learn_from_history/">Failing to Learn from History</a></p></body></html>
