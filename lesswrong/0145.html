It's probably a bad question to ask anyone with a creative imagination.  Let's consider the problem on an individual level: it's not really the <em>worst</em> that can happen, but would nonetheless be fairly bad, if you were horribly tortured for a number of years.  This is one of the worse things that can <em>realistically</em> happen to one person in today's world.</p> <p>What's the <em>least</em> bad, bad thing that can happen?  Well, suppose a dust speck floated into your eye and irritated it just a little, for a fraction of a second, barely enough to make you notice before you blink and wipe away the dust speck.</p> <p>For our next ingredient, we need a large number.  Let's use 3^^^3, written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation">Knuth's up-arrow notation</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_up-arrow_notation]:</p> <ul><li>3^3 = 27.</li> <li>3^^3 = (3^(3^3)) = 3^27 = 7625597484987.</li> <li>3^^^3 = (3^^(3^^3)) = 3^^7625597484987 = (3^(3^(3^(... 7625597484987 times ...)))).</li></ul> <p>3^^^3 is an exponential tower of 3s which is 7,625,597,484,987 layers tall.  You start with 1; raise 3 to the power of 1 to get 3; raise 3 to the power of 3 to get 27; raise 3 to the power of 27 to get 7625597484987; raise 3 to the power of 7625597484987 to get a number much larger than the number of atoms in the universe, but which could still be <em>written down</em> in base 10, on 100 square kilometers of paper; then raise 3 to <em>that</em> power; and continue until you've exponentiated 7625597484987 times.  That's 3^^^3.  It's the smallest simple inconceivably huge number I know.</p> <p>Now here's the moral dilemma.  If neither event is going to happen to you personally, but you still had to choose one or the other:</p> <p>Would you prefer that one person be horribly tortured for fifty years without hope or rest, or that 3^^^3 people get dust specks in their eyes?</p> <p>I think the answer is obvious.  How about you?</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0146.html">A Case Study of Motivated Continuation</a> &#8226; <a href="0147.html">A Terrifying Halloween Costume</a> &#8226; <a href="0169.html">Not for the Sake of Happiness (Alone)</a> &#8226; <a href="0218.html">Infinite Certainty</a> &#8226; <a href="0233.html">Circular Altruism</a> &#8226; <a href="0521.html">Ethics Notes</a> &#8226; <a href="0535.html">Complexity and Intelligence</a> &#8226; <a href="0610.html">Continuous Improvement</a> &#8226; <a href="0641.html">(Moral) Truth in Fiction?</a> &#8226; <a href="0762.html">The Lifespan Dilemma</a> &#8226; <a href="0828.html">Pascal's Muggle: Infinitesimal Priors and Strong Evidence</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/kn/torture_vs_dust_specks/">Torture vs. Dust Specks</a></p></body></html>
