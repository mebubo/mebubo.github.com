<html><head><title>Less Meta</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>Less Meta</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 26 April 2009 05:38AM</i></p><div><p>My recent sequence on the craft and the community is highly forward-looking&#8212;not an immediately whole recipe, but a list of action items and warnings for anyone setting out in the future.  Having expended this much effort already, it seems worthwhile to try and leverage others' future efforts.</p> <p>That sequence seemed like an appropriate finale, but putting it last had some side effects that I didn't expect.  Thanks to <a href="http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/recency_effect.htm">the recency effect</a> [http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/recency_effect.htm], people are now talking as if the entire &#339;uvre had all been anticipation of future awesomeness, with no practical value in the present...</p> <p>Okay, seriously, if you look over <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~andwhay/postlist.html">my posts on Overcoming Bias</a> [http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~andwhay/postlist.html] that are <em>not</em> just a couple of months old, you really should see <em>quite a lot</em> of practical day-to-day stuff.  Yes, there's a long sequence on quantum mechanics, but there really <em>is</em> plenty of day-to-day stuff, right down to <a href="0175.html">applying biases of evaluability to save money on holiday shopping</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/lh/evaluability_and_cheap_holiday_shopping/].  (Not to mention that I finally did derive real-world advice out of the QM detour!)</p> <p>I suspect there may also be a problem here with present schools not teaching people the experience of creating <em>new</em> craft.  What they present you with, is what you learn.  So when I talk about my belief that <em>we could be doing better</em>, they look around and say:  "But we <em>aren't </em>doing that well!" rather than "Hm, how can we make progress on this?"</p> <p>And then your current accomplishments start to <a href="0640.html">pale in the light of grander dreams</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ye/and_say_no_more_of_it/], etcetera.  One of the great lessons of Artificial Intelligence is that no matter <em>how</em> much progress you make, it can <em>always</em> be made to appear slow and unexciting just by having someone else quoted in the newspapers about much grander promises on which they fail to deliver.</p> <p>Anyway.  I think that discussion here is going a bit too meta, too much about the community, and that was <em>not</em> the final push I had planned to deliver.  (I know, I know, obvious in retrospect, yes, but I still didn't see it coming.)  Hence the quick add-on about practical advice backed by experimental results or deep theories&#8212;thankfully we are going back to those again in <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/d2/cached_procrastination/">recent</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/d2/cached_procrastination/] posts.</p> <p>So if it's all right with you, dear readers, after the end of April, I will not promote more than one meta post unless at least four nonmeta posts have appeared before it&#8212;does that sound fair?</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="0726.html"><em>The Craft and the Community</em></a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/cz/the_craft_and_the_community/]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0722.html">Go Forth and Create the Art!</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/c4/go_forth_and_create_the_art/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0724.html">Practical Advice Backed By Deep Theories</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/d4/practical_advice_backed_by_deep_theories/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq16.html">Sequence 16: The Craft and the Community</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0724.html">Practical Advice Backed By Deep Theories</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0722.html">Go Forth and Create the Art!</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0722.html">Go Forth and Create the Art!</a> &#8226; <a href="0724.html">Practical Advice Backed By Deep Theories</a> &#8226; <a href="0726.html">The Craft and the Community</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/d3/less_meta/">Less Meta</a></p></body></html>
