Once the plan is in motion, the final action no longer requires an effortful <em>decision</em> - that's the theory, anyway.  And to <em>start </em>the plan doesn't require as much effort because I just have to think "10, 9..."</p> <p>As usual with such things, there's no way to tell whether it works because it's based on any sort of realistic insight or if it works because I believe it works; and in fact this is one of those cases that blurs the boundary between the two.</p> <p>The technique was originally inspired by reading some neurologist suggesting that what we have is not "free will" so much as "free won't": that is, frontal reflection is mainly good for suppressing the default mode of action, more than originating new actions.</p> <p>Pondering that for a bit inspired the idea that - if the brain carries out certain plans by default - it might conserve willpower to first visualize a sequence of actions and try to 'mark' it as the default plan, and then <em>lift</em> the attention-of-decision that agonizes whether or not to do it, thus <em>allowing</em> that default to happen.<a id="more"></a></p> <p>For the record, I can remember a time some years ago when I would have been all enthusiastic about this sort of thing, believing that I had discovered this incredible new technique that might revolutionize my whole daily life.  Today, while I know that there <em>are</em> discoverables with that kind of power, I also know that it usually requires beginning from <a href="0724.html">firmer foundations</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/d4/practical_advice_backed_by_deep_theories/] - reports of controlled experiments, a standard theory in the field, and maybe even math.  On the scale of depth I now use, this sort of trick ranks as pretty shallow - and in fact I really <em>do</em> use it <em>just</em> for getting out of bed.</p> <p>I offer this trick as an example of <a href="0724.html">practical advice <em>not</em> backed by deep theories</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/d4/practical_advice_backed_by_deep_theories/], of the sort that you can find on a hundred other productivity blogs.  At best it may work for some of you some of the time.  Consider yourself warned about the enthusiasm thing.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/fh/willpower_hax_487_execute_by_default/">Willpower Hax #487: Execute by Default</a></p></body></html>
