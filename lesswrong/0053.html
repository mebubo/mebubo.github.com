One says, "Yes it does, for it makes vibrations in the air." Another says, "No it does not, for there is no auditory processing in any brain."</em></p> <p>Suppose that, after the tree falls, the two walk into the forest together. Will one expect to see the tree fallen to the right, and the other expect to see the tree fallen to the left? Suppose that before the tree falls, the two leave a sound recorder next to the tree. Would one, playing back the recorder, expect to hear something different from the other? Suppose they attach an electroencephalograph to any brain in the world; would one expect to see a different trace than the other? Though the two argue, one saying "No," and the other saying "Yes," they do not anticipate any different experiences.  The two think they have different models of the world, but they have no difference with respect to what they expect will <em>happen to</em> them.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>It's tempting to try to eliminate this mistake class by insisting that the only legitimate kind of belief is an anticipation of sensory experience. But the world does, in fact, contain much that is not sensed directly. We don't see the atoms underlying the brick, but the atoms are in fact there. There is a floor beneath your feet, but you don't <em>experience</em> the floor directly; you see the light <em>reflected</em> from the floor, or rather, you see what your retina and visual cortex have processed of that light. To infer the floor from seeing the floor is to step back into the unseen causes of experience. It may seem like a very short and direct step, but it is still a step.</p> <p>You stand on top of a tall building, next to a grandfather clock with an hour, minute, and ticking second hand. In your hand is a bowling ball, and you drop it off the roof. On which tick of the clock will you hear the crash of the bowling ball hitting the ground?</p> <p>To answer precisely, you must use beliefs like <em>Earth's gravity is 9.8 meters per second per second,</em> and <em>This building is around 120 meters tall.</em> These beliefs are not wordless anticipations of a sensory experience; they are verbal-ish, propositional. It probably does not exaggerate much to describe these two beliefs as sentences made out of words. But these two beliefs have an inferential <em>consequence</em> that is a direct sensory anticipation&#8212;if the clock's second hand is on the 12 numeral when you drop the ball, you anticipate seeing it on the 1 numeral when you hear the crash five seconds later. To anticipate sensory experiences as precisely as possible, we must process beliefs that are not anticipations of sensory experience.</p> <p>It is a great strength of <em>Homo sapiens</em> that we can, better than any other species in the world, learn to model the unseen. It is also one of our great weak points. Humans often believe in things that are not only unseen but unreal.</p> <p>The same brain that builds a network of inferred causes behind sensory experience, can also build a network of causes that is not connected to sensory experience, or poorly connected. Alchemists believed that phlogiston caused fire&#8212;we could oversimply their minds by drawing a little node labeled "Phlogiston", and an arrow from this node to their sensory experience of a crackling campfire&#8212;but this belief yielded no advance predictions; the link from phlogiston to experience was always configured after the experience, rather than constraining the experience in advance. Or suppose your postmodern English professor teaches you that the famous writer Wulky Wilkinsen is actually a "post-utopian". What does this mean you should expect from his books? Nothing. The belief, if you can call it that, doesn't connect to sensory experience at all. But you had better remember the propositional assertion that "Wulky Wilkinsen" has the "post-utopian" attribute, so you can regurgitate it on the upcoming quiz. Likewise if "post-utopians" show "colonial alienation"; if the quiz asks whether Wulky Wilkinsen shows colonial alienation, you'd better answer yes. The beliefs are connected to each other, though still not connected to any anticipated experience.</p> <p>We can build up whole networks of beliefs that are connected only to each other&#8212;call these "floating" beliefs. It is a uniquely human flaw among animal species, a perversion of <em>Homo sapiens's</em> ability to build more general and flexible belief networks.</p> <p>The rationalist virtue of <em>empiricism</em> consists of constantly asking which experiences our beliefs predict&#8212;or better yet, prohibit.  Do you believe that phlogiston is the cause of fire?  Then what do you expect to see happen, because of that? Do you believe that Wulky Wilkinsen is a post-utopian? Then what do you expect to see because of that? No, not "colonial alienation"; <em>what experience will happen to you?</em> Do you believe that if a tree falls in the forest, and no one hears it, it still makes a sound? Then what experience must therefore befall you?</p> <p>It is even better to ask: what experience <em>must not</em> happen to you?  Do you believe that <em>elan vital</em> explains the mysterious aliveness of living beings?  Then what does this belief <em>not</em> allow to happen&#8212;what would definitely falsify this belief? A null answer means that your belief does not <em>constrain</em> experience; it permits <em>anything</em> to happen to you.  It floats.</p> <p>When you argue a seemingly factual question, always keep in mind which difference of anticipation you are arguing about. If you can't find the difference of anticipation, you're probably arguing about labels in your belief network&#8212;or even worse, floating beliefs, barnacles on your network. If you don't know what experiences are implied by Wulky Wilkinsen being a post-utopian, you can go on arguing forever. (You can also publish papers forever.)</p> <p>Above all, don't ask what to believe&#8212;ask what to anticipate. Every question of belief should flow from a question of anticipation, and that question of anticipation should be the center of the inquiry. Every guess of belief should begin by flowing to a specific guess of anticipation, and should continue to pay rent in future anticipations. If a belief turns deadbeat, evict it.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the sequence <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions"><em>Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Mysterious_Answers_to_Mysterious_Questions]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0054.html">Belief in Belief</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq02.html">Sequence 02: Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="seq01.html">Sequence 01: Map and Territory</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0054.html">Belief in Belief</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0054.html">Belief in Belief</a> &#8226; <a href="0057.html">Belief as Attire</a> &#8226; <a href="0058.html">Religion's Claim to be Non-Disprovable</a> &#8226; <a href="0061.html">The Proper Use of Doubt</a> &#8226; <a href="0065.html">Your Strength as a Rationalist</a> &#8226; <a href="0075.html">Fake Explanations</a> &#8226; <a href="0078.html">Fake Causality</a> &#8226; <a href="0080.html">Mysterious Answers to Mysterious Questions</a> &#8226; <a href="0157.html">Fake Optimization Criteria</a> &#8226; <a href="0168.html">Truly Part Of You</a> &#8226; <a href="0173.html">Purpose and Pragmatism</a> &#8226; <a href="0222.html">Is Reality Ugly?</a> &#8226; <a href="0256.html">Feel the Meaning</a> &#8226; <a href="0261.html">Replace the Symbol with the Substance</a> &#8226; <a href="0281.html">Dissolving the Question</a> &#8226; <a href="0314.html">Quantum Explanations</a> &#8226; <a href="0329.html">Which Basis Is More Fundamental?</a> &#8226; <a href="0335.html">Decoherent Essences</a> &#8226; <a href="0352.html">Do Scientists Already Know This Stuff?</a> &#8226; <a href="0363.html">Timeless Physics</a> &#8226; <a href="0385.html">Possibility and Could-ness</a> &#8226; <a href="0427.html">Can Counterfactuals Be True?</a> &#8226; <a href="0431.html">Setting Up Metaethics</a> &#8226; <a href="0437.html">The Comedy of Behaviorism</a> &#8226; <a href="0438.html">No Logical Positivist I</a> &#8226; <a href="0526.html">Belief in Intelligence</a> &#8226; <a href="0674.html">Raising the Sanity Waterline</a> &#8226; <a href="0722.html">Go Forth and Create the Art!</a> &#8226; <a href="0724.html">Practical Advice Backed By Deep Theories</a> &#8226; <a href="0805.html">SotW: Be Specific</a> &#8226; <a href="0814.html">Causal Diagrams and Causal Models</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/">Making Beliefs Pay Rent (in Anticipated Experiences)</a></p></body></html>
