Theories that explain intelligence, on the other hand, are fiendishly difficult to come by and so are profoundly useful.

When that rock is lifted the earth is lighter, the hand that bears it heavier. When it is thrown the circuits of the stars respond, and where it strikes or falls the universe is changed. On every act the balance of the whole depends. The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth and light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale's sounding to the fall of a dry leaf and the flight of a gnat, all they do is done within the balance of the whole. But we, in so far as we have power over the world and over one another, we must <em>learn</em> to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature. We must learn to keep the balance. Having intelligence, we must not act in ignorance. Having choice, we must not act without responsibility. Who am I - though I have the power to do it - to punish and reward, playing with men's destinies?"<br>    "But then," the boy said, frowning at the stars, "is the balance to be kept by doing nothing? Surely a man must act, even not knowing all the consequences of his act, if anything is to be done at all?"<br>    "Never fear. It is much easier for men to act than to refrain from acting. We will continue to do good, and to do evil... But if there were a king over us all again, and he sought counsel of a mage, as in the days of old, and I were that mage, I would say to him: My lord, do nothing because it is righteous, or praiseworthy, or noble, to do so; do nothing because it seems good to do so; do only that which you must do, and which you cannot do in any other way."<br>  &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160; -- Ursula K. LeGuin, <em>The Farthest Shore</em></span></p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/oa/rationality_quotes_10/">Rationality Quotes 10</a></p></body></html>
