The mere presence of a personal attack does not indicate ad hominem: the attack must be used for the purpose of undermining the argument, or otherwise the logical fallacy isn't there.</p> <p>[...]</p><blockquote><p><em> A: "All rodents are mammals, but a weasel isn't a rodent, so it can't be a mammal." <br>B: "You evidently know nothing about logic. This does not logically follow." </em></p></blockquote> <p>B's argument is still not ad hominem.  B does not imply that A's sentence does not logically follow <em>because</em> A knows nothing about logic.  B is still addressing the substance of A's argument...</p></blockquote><p>This is too beautiful, thorough, and precise to not post.
