(Or find someone else who already has or is renting a boat and still has a spare spot, etc.)  Jul 22-25 with an unconference (i.e., show up and give a talk) on Saturday the 24th.  Posting here because of the large <em>de facto </em>overlap in the communities.  The location is about a two-hour drive from the Bay Area.</p> <p><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/floating-festival/web/main-info-page">Main info page</a> [http://groups.google.com/group/floating-festival/web/main-info-page].</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0795.html">Bay Area Events Roundup</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2hi/floating_festival_jul_2225/">Floating Festival Jul 22-25</a></p></body></html>
