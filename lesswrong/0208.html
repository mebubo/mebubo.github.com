<html><head><title>My Strange Beliefs</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>My Strange Beliefs</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 30 December 2007 12:15PM</i></p><div><p>Yesterday, "Overcoming Cryonics" wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Eliezer, enough with your nonsense about cryonicism, life-extensionism, trans-humanism, and the singularity.  These things have <strong>nothing</strong> to do with overcoming bias... if you're going to enforce the comments policy then you should also self-enforce the overcoming bias posting policy instead of using posts to blithely proselytize your cryonicism / life-extensionism / trans-humanism / singularity religion.</p> </blockquote> <p>One, there is nothing in the <em>Overcoming Bias</em> <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1/about_less_wrong/">posting policy</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1/about_less_wrong/] against transhumanism.</p> <p>Two, as a matter of fact, I <em>do</em> try to avoid proselytizing here.  I have other forums in which to vent my thoughts on transhumanism.  When I write a blog post proselytizing transhumanism, it looks like <a href="http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/">this</a> [http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/06/16/transhumanism-as-simplified-humanism/], <a href="http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/10/14/the-meaning-that-immortality-gives-to-life/">this</a> [http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/10/14/the-meaning-that-immortality-gives-to-life/], or <a href="http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/09/30/three-major-singularity-schools/">this</a> [http://intelligence.org/blog/2007/09/30/three-major-singularity-schools/].</p> <p>But it's hard for me to avoid <em>all</em> references to transhumanism.  "Overcoming Cryonics" commented to a post in which there was exactly one reference to a transhumanist topic.  I had said:</p> <blockquote> <p>The first time I gave a presentation - the first time I ever climbed onto a stage in front of a couple of hundred people to talk about the Singularity - I briefly thought to myself:  "I bet most people would be experiencing 'stage fright' about now.  But that wouldn't be helpful, so I'm not going to go there.</p> </blockquote> <p>What, exactly, am I supposed to do about that?  The first time I ever got up on stage, I was in fact talking about the Singularity!  That's the actual history!  Transhumanism is not a hobby for me, it's my paid day job as a Research Fellow of the Singularity Institute.  Asking me to avoid all mentions of transhumanism is like asking Robin Hanson to avoid all mentions of academia.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>Occasionally, someone remarks that I seem to take notions like the <a href="http://intelligence.org/AIRisks.pdf">Singularity</a> [http://intelligence.org/AIRisks.pdf] on faith, because I mention them but don't defend them.</p> <p>I don't defend my views <em>here.  </em>Because I know that not everyone is interested in the considerable volume of work I have produced on transhumanism.  Which you can find on <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/">yudkowsky.net</a> [http://yudkowsky.net/].</p> <p>If, however, you don't like <em>any</em> mention of transhumanism, even as an illustration of some other point about rationality - well, this is a blog.  These are blog posts.  They are written in the first person.  I am occasionally going to use anecdotes from my history, or even, y'know, transcribe my thought processes a little?</p> <p>Given the amount of time that I spend thinking about transhumanism, I naturally tend to think of transhumanist illustrations for my points about rationality.  If I had spent the last eleven years as a geologist, I would find it easy to illustrate my ideas by talking about rocks.  If you don't like my illustrations and think you can <a href="0022.html">do better</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/h8/tsuyoku_naritai_i_want_to_become_stronger/], feel free to invent superior illustrations and post them in the comments.  I may even adopt them.</p> <p>On some transhumanist topics, such as cryonics, I haven't written all that much myself.  But there is plenty about cryonics at <a href="http://alcor.org/">Alcor</a> [http://alcor.org/] or <a href="http://cryonics.org/">Cryonics Institute</a> [http://cryonics.org/].<em> </em>  Also, the <a href="http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/faq.html">Transhumanist FAQ</a> [http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/faq.html] has some nice intros.  If you don't want it discussed here, then why are you asking?</p> <p>I will probably post explicitly on cryonics at some point, because I think there are some points about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_grapes">sour grapes</a> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_grapes] for which I would have difficulty finding an equally strong illustration.  Meanwhile, yes, I sometimes do mention "cryonics" as the archetype for a socially weird belief which happens to be true.  No matter <em>what</em> I use as an example of "socially weird but true", <em>some</em> people are going to disagree with it.  Otherwise it wouldn't be an example.  And <a href="0090.html">weird-but-true</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j4/absurdity_heuristic_absurdity_bias/] is certainly an important topic in rationality - otherwise there would be a knockdown argument against ever <a href="0005.html">dissenting</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/gr/the_modesty_argument/].</p> <p>Even after checking the referenced sources, you might find that you - gasp! - still disagree with me.  Oh, the horror!  The horror!  You don't read any <em>other </em>blogs where one of the authors occasionally disagrees with you.</p> <p>Just because this blog is called <em>Overcoming Bias,</em> it does not mean that any time any author says something you disagree with, you should comment "<a href="0028.html">OMG!  How biased!</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/]  I am <em>sooo</em> disappointed in you I thought you would do better."  Part of the art of rationality is having extended discussions with people you disagree with.  "OMG U R BIASED!" does not present much basis for continuing discussion.</p> <p>It is a good rule of thumb that you should never flatly accuse someone of being "biased".  Name the specific bias that attaches to the specific problem.  <a href="0104.html">Conjunction fallacy</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/]?  <a href="0091.html">Availability</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/j5/availability/]?</p> <p>If you disagree with someone, you presumably think they're doing <em>something</em> wrong.  Saying "You are like so totally biased, dude" is not helpful.  If you strike a tragic, sorrowful pose and go, "Oh, alas, oh, woe, I am so disappointed in you," it is still not helpful.  If you point to a specific belief that you disagree with, and say, "See, that belief is biased," then that doesn't convey any additional information beyond "I disagree with that belief."  <em>Which</em> bias?  There's quite a lot of possibilities.</p> <p>If you think that "rationality" means people will agree with you on their first try, so that anyone who doesn't do this can be dismissed out of hand as a poseur, you have an exaggerated idea of how <a href="0138.html">obvious</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/kg/expecting_short_inferential_distances/] your beliefs are<em>.</em></p> <p>So stop telling me, or Robin Hanson, "Why, you... <em>you...</em> you're <em>not absolutely rational!</em>"  We already know that.</p> <p>Just because I try to be rational doesn't mean I think I'm a god.</p> <p>Well, sure, I want to be a god when I grow up, but that is like a totally different issue from that first part.</p> <p>Except that both goals involve Bayesian methods.</p> <p>(And are intertwined in other ways you won't realize until it's too late to turn back.)</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>Yours in the darkest abyssal depths of sincerity,<br>Eliezer Yudkowsky.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0211.html">The American System and Misleading Labels</a> &#8226; <a href="0232.html">Against Discount Rates</a> &#8226; <a href="0324.html">Identity Isn't In Specific Atoms</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/me/my_strange_beliefs/">My Strange Beliefs</a></p></body></html>
