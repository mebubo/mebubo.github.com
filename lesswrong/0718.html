On the other hand, famous <em>failures</em> are much more likely to contain lessons on what to avoid next time.</p> <p>Books about epic screwups have constituted some of my more enlightening reading.  Do you have any such books to recommend?</p> <p>Please break up multiple recommendations into multiple comments, one book per comment, so they can be voted on and discussed separately.  And please say at least a little about the book's subject and what sort of lesson you learned from it.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/bx/great_books_of_failure/">Great Books of Failure</a></p></body></html>
