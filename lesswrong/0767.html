(Vassar would have won quite a few points for his superior predictions of Singularity Summit 2009 attendance - I was pessimistic, Vassar was accurate.)</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1bh/predictionbookcom_track_your_calibration/">PredictionBook.com - Track your calibration</a></p></body></html>
