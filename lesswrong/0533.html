Reductionism, zombies, and questions that you're not allowed to answer:</p> <p><embed width="380" src="http://www.bloggingheads.tv/maulik/offsite/offsite_flvplayer.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" flashvars="file=http%3A%2F%2Fbloggingheads%2Etv%2Fdiavlogs%2Fliveplayer%2Dplaylist%2F15555%3Fin%3D00%3A00%26out%3D60%3A31" height="288"></embed></p> <p>This ended up being more of me interviewing Lanier than a dialog, I'm afraid.  I was a little too reluctant to interrupt.  But you at least get a chance to see the probes I use, and Lanier's replies to them.</p> <p>If there are any BHTV heads out there who read Overcoming Bias and have something they'd like to talk to me about, do let me or our kindly producers know.</p> </div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/vf/bhtv_jaron_lanier_and_yudkowsky/">BHTV: Jaron Lanier and Yudkowsky</a></p></body></html>
