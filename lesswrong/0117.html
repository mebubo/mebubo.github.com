Now, I studied Bayes conditional probabilities in Statistics class in University many years ago, but my knowledge of the theory ends there. Can you recommend any good books on the subject?</p> <p>In fact, do you folks have a recommended reading list (other than this blog, of course!) for those trying to identify and overcome their own biases?</p> </div> </blockquote> <div> <p>I second the question.  My own recommendations will be found in the comments.</p> </div></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jv/recommended_rationalist_reading/">Recommended Rationalist Reading</a></p></body></html>
