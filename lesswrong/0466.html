I'll post small units of rationality quotes each day, so as to not quite abandon you.  I may even post some actual writing, if I feel spontaneous, but definitely not for the next two days; I have to enforce this break upon myself.</p> <p>When I get back, my schedule calls for me to finish up the Anthropomorphism sequence, and then talk about Marcus Hutter's AIXI, which I think is the last brain-malfunction-causing subject I need to discuss.  My posts should then hopefully go back to being shorter and easier.</p> <p>Hey, at least I got through over a solid year of posts without taking a vacation.</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/tk/brief_break/">Brief Break</a></p></body></html>
