Ideally, in a form that will let me make small modifications myself.  This is likely to lead into other graphic design work on producing the ebooks, redesigning my personal website, creating Bayesian Conspiracy T-shirts, etc.</p> <p>I am <em>not</em> looking for an unpaid volunteer.  I am looking for a professional graphic designer who can do sporadic small units of work quickly.</p><a id="more"></a><p> Desired style for the presentation:  Professional-looking and easy-to-read (as opposed to flamboyant / elaborate).  I already have the presentation content, in black text on white background.  I would like it to look like it was produced by a grownup, which is beyond my own skill.
