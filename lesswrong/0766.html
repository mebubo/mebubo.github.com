That's a bit unfair.  I never said during my talk that most people are stupid.  In fact, I was very careful not to say, at any point, that people are stupid, because that's explicitly <em>not</em> what I believe.</p> <p>I don't think that people who believe in <a href="0344.html">single-world quantum mechanics</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/q6/collapse_postulates/] are <a href="0345.html">stupid</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/q7/if_manyworlds_had_come_first/].  John von Neumann believed in a collapse postulate.</p> <p>I don't think that philosophers who believe in the "possibility" of <a href="0309.html">zombies</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/p7/zombies_zombies/] are <a href="0325.html">stupid</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/].  David Chalmers believes in zombies.</p> <p>I don't even think that <a href="0477.html">theists</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/tv/excluding_the_supernatural/] are <a href="0674.html">stupid</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/].  Robert Aumann believes in Orthodox Judaism.</p> <p>And in the closing sentence of my talk on cognitive biases and existential risk, I did not say that humanity was devoting more resources to football than existential risk prevention because we were stupid.</p> <p>There's an old joke that runs as follows:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">A motorist is driving past a mental hospital when he gets a flat tire.<br>He goes out to change the tire, and sees that one of the patients is watching him through the fence.<br>Nervous, trying to work quickly, he jacks up the car, takes off the wheel, puts the lugnuts into the hubcap -<br>And steps on the hubcap, sending the lugnuts clattering into a storm drain.<br>The mental patient is still watching him through the fence.<br>The motorist desperately looks into the storm drain, but the lugnuts are gone.<br>The patient is still watching.<br>The motorist paces back and forth, trying to think of what to do -<br>And the patient says,<br>"Take one lugnut off each of the other tires, and you'll have three lugnuts on each."<br>"That's brilliant!" says the motorist.  "What's someone like you doing in an asylum?"<br>"I'm here because I'm crazy," says the patient, "not because I'm stupid."</p></div> <hr><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/1ax/im_not_saying_people_are_stupid/">I'm Not Saying People Are Stupid</a></p></body></html>
