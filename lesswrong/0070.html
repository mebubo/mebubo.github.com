<html><head><title>One Argument Against An Army</title></head><body style="width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><h1>One Argument Against An Army</h1><p><i>Eliezer Yudkowsky, 15 August 2007 06:39PM</i></p><div><p><strong>Followup to:</strong>  <a href="0069.html">Update Yourself Incrementally</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ij/update_yourself_incrementally/]</p> <p>Yesterday I talked about a style of reasoning in which <a href="0069.html">not a single contrary argument is allowed, with the result that every non-supporting observation has to be argued away</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ij/update_yourself_incrementally/].  Today I suggest that when people encounter a contrary argument, they prevent themselves from downshifting their confidence by <em>rehearsing</em> already-known support.</p> <p>Suppose the country of Freedonia is debating whether its neighbor, Sylvania, is responsible for a recent rash of meteor strikes on its cities.  There are several pieces of evidence suggesting this: the meteors struck cities close to the Sylvanian border; there was unusual activity in the Sylvanian stock markets <em>before</em> the strikes; and the Sylvanian ambassador Trentino was heard muttering about "heavenly vengeance".</p> <p>Someone comes to you and says:  "I don't think Sylvania is responsible for the meteor strikes.  They have trade with us of billions of dinars annually."  "Well," you reply, "the meteors struck cities close to Sylvania, there was suspicious activity in their stock market, and their ambassador spoke of heavenly vengeance afterward."  Since these three arguments outweigh the first, you <em>keep</em> your belief that Sylvania is responsible&#8212;you believe rather than disbelieve, qualitatively. Clearly, the balance of evidence weighs against Sylvania.</p> <p>Then another comes to you and says:  "I don't think Sylvania is responsible for the meteor strikes.  Directing an asteroid strike is really hard. Sylvania doesn't even have a space program."  You reply, "But the meteors struck cities close to Sylvania, and their investors knew it, and the ambassador came right out and admitted it!"  Again, these three arguments outweigh the first (by three arguments against one argument), so you keep your belief that Sylvania is responsible.</p> <p>Indeed, your convictions are <em>strengthened.</em>  On two separate occasions now, you have evaluated the balance of evidence, and both times the balance was tilted against Sylvania by a ratio of 3-to-1.</p> <p><a id="more"></a></p> <p>You encounter further arguments by the pro-Sylvania traitors&#8212;again, and again, and a hundred times again&#8212;but each time the new argument is handily defeated by 3-to-1.  And on every occasion, you feel yourself becoming more confident that Sylvania was indeed responsible, shifting your prior according to the felt balance of evidence.</p> <p>The problem, of course, is that by <em>rehearsing</em> arguments you <em>already knew,</em> you are double-counting the evidence  This would be a grave sin even if you double-counted <em>all</em> the evidence.  (Imagine a scientist who does an experiment with 50 subjects and fails to obtain statistically significant results, so he counts all the data twice.)</p> <p>But to selectively double-count <em>only some</em> evidence is sheer farce.  I remember seeing a cartoon as a child, where a villain was dividing up loot using the following algorithm:  "One for you, one for me.  One for you, one-two for me.  One for you, one-two-three for me."</p> <p>As I emphasized <a href="0069.html">yesterday,</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ij/update_yourself_incrementally/] even if a cherished belief is <em>true,</em> a rationalist may sometimes need to downshift the probability while integrating <em>all</em> the evidence.  Yes, the balance of support may still favor your cherished belief.  But you still have to shift the probability <em>down</em>&#8212;yes, <em>down</em>&#8212;from whatever it was before you heard the contrary evidence.  It does no good to <em>rehearse</em> supporting arguments, because you have already taken those into account.</p> <p>And yet it does appear to me that when people are confronted by a <em>new</em> counterargument, they search for a justification not to downshift their confidence, and of course they find supporting arguments they <em>already know.</em>  I have to keep constant vigilance not to do this myself!  It feels as natural as parrying a sword-strike with a handy shield.</p> <p>With the right kind of wrong reasoning, a handful of support&#8212;or even a single argument&#8212;can stand off an army of contradictions.</p> <p> </p> <p style="text-align:right">Part of the <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#Against_Rationalization"><em>Against Rationalization</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind#Against_Rationalization] subsequence of <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind"><em>How To Actually Change Your Mind</em></a> [http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/How_To_Actually_Change_Your_Mind]</p> <p style="text-align:right">Next post: "<a href="0114.html">The Bottom Line</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/]"</p> <p style="text-align:right">Previous post: "<a href="0069.html">Update Yourself Incrementally</a> [http://lesswrong.com/lw/ij/update_yourself_incrementally/]"</p></div> <hr><table><tr><th colspan="2"><a href="seq07.html">Sequence 07: Against Rationalization</a>:</th></tr><tr><td><p><i>Previous: </i><a href="0069.html">Update Yourself Incrementally</a></p></td><td><p><i>Next: </i><a href="0114.html">The Bottom Line</a></p></td></tr></table><p><i>Referenced by: </i><a href="0069.html">Update Yourself Incrementally</a> &#8226; <a href="0114.html">The Bottom Line</a> &#8226; <a href="0115.html">What Evidence Filtered Evidence?</a> &#8226; <a href="0120.html">Avoiding Your Belief's Real Weak Points</a> &#8226; <a href="0121.html">The Meditation on Curiosity</a> &#8226; <a href="0125.html">Priming and Contamination</a> &#8226; <a href="0181.html">Resist the Happy Death Spiral</a> &#8226; <a href="0390.html">LA-602 vs. RHIC Review</a> &#8226; <a href="0413.html">The Genetic Fallacy</a> &#8226; <a href="0414.html">Fundamental Doubts</a> &#8226; <a href="0490.html">Fighting a Rearguard Action Against the Truth</a> &#8226; <a href="0509.html">Crisis of Faith</a> &#8226; <a href="0642.html">Informers and Persuaders</a> &#8226; <a href="0708.html">That Crisis thing seems pretty useful</a></p><p><i>Original with comments: </i><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ik/one_argument_against_an_army/">One Argument Against An Army</a></p></body></html>
